With GitHub codespaces you can use Ubuntu os, and visually it gives you feel of vs code. You can also active your GitHub student developer pack and get 180 hours of GitHub codespaces and some more benefits such as cloud resources and domains.\nI have done all questions of week1 and week2 on codespaces only, codespaces works very well if you have good internet connection."

    "content": "Greetings @s.anand, @Jivraj and @carlton !\nI just finished this course with good marks (I think) and wanted to thank you for this wonderful course and also some feedbacks as the course pattern was changed this term.\n\n\nThe course content covers most tools and techniques needed in Data Science in just 9 weeks.\n\n\nThe extremely hard ROE did push me beyond my limits and with the help of friendship , I managed to crack it.\n\n\nAs for the Projects , they were pretty interesting and gave a good learning experience. I have completed all subjects in Diploma and I am experienced in programming so it went well for me.  But students who are doing this subject early in their Diploma will find it pretty difficult especially Project 2 . So, one suggestion would be to add prerequisites for this subject and suggest them to take TDS in their last term.\n\n\nThe End Term was easy but there was no point on adding a question to calculate a lengthy expression manually to calculate distance. It proves nothing except that I am good at mathematics.\n\n\nSpecial mentions to @carlton for those great live sessions. That really helped !\nThat as well. Thank you again.\nAmit."

Therefore its very much like our expectatations and see no strange artifacts.\nWhile some might feel otherwise, we are very confident in the random samples we examined (including those that complained), about how robust and surprisingly fair the evaluator was.\nIt did a phenomenal job, i would even go so far to say its fairer than the peer review system that was prone to wildly varying quality, non reviews that caused enormous backlogs to scoring due to students being unreliable.\nI think we could have done a better job communicating the evaluation process,  but what students fail to appreciate is how cutting edge this all is for you and for us. You should be proud of what you have learnt. You may not realise it but you now belong to an elite group on the bleeding edge of data science.\nFor Project 1,\nAlthough i do not have the graph, students scored better in Project 1, so the median moves to the right.\nKind regards"

    "content": "Dear Tds team @carlton @jkmadathil @Bharathi @andrew ,\nI hope this message finds you well. I would like to clarify my position and outline the key concerns regarding the evaluation of Project 2.\nFirstly, let me emphasize that I have no issue with the discussion, learning objectives, or goals of the project. In fact, I thoroughly enjoy challenges and have appreciated this course more than any other in the diploma program. However, there is a clear distinction between engaging in academic exploration and the critical impact of grading, which directly influences our final results.\nNow, addressing the core issue:\nAttached below is a screenshot of the final evaluation results:\nimage1918\u00d7983 109 KB\nThese evaluation fields, which were hidden during the final evaluation, significantly affected (and, in my case, diminished) my final score. For instance:\n\nReadMe Evaluation:\nHow did the LLM determine that my ReadMe file lacked the necessary headings or structure? This judgment appears inconsistent and lacks transparency.\nChart Relevance:\nHow did the LLM evaluate the relevance of the charts in my submission? The charts I provided were entirely aligned with the project goals.\nimage1412\u00d7969 104 KB\nFor reference, my submission can be reviewed here: GitHub Repository.\n\nTo explore alternative evaluation methods, if peer review had been used, I believe it is reasonable to estimate that my final score would have ranged between 80-90%. This aligns with the initial evaluation script, which scored my submission at 89% (14/14).\n\nThis created a false sense of confidence for many students, myself included, that our scripts were adequately optimized and would receive a decent grade (as the evaluation script used llm to determine the final grade for test cases and it took a lot of time to take it from 4/14 to 14/14). This lack of transparency in the evaluation process led to confusion and ultimately to disappointment when the final grades were released.\nCritical Concerns:\n\nTransparency:\nHow do you justify the drastic reduction of a score from 89% (based on the initial evaluation) to a mere 41% in the final evaluation? This inconsistency undermines the credibility of the grading system.\nIntegrity:\nThe final evaluation process appears to have serious flaws. A peer review would likely have produced a score closer to 90%, which is far more representative of the effort and quality of the submission. The current system\u2019s inability to provide consistent and reliable results is concerning.\nImpact on Grades:\nThe abrupt decline in scores has directly impacted our final grade points, in some cases, reducing them from a \u2018B\u2019 to a \u2018C.\u2019 This disproportionately penalizes students and fails to reflect their genuine efforts.\n\nProposed Solutions:\n\nReevaluate all submissions using a new and fair evaluation script (though I understand this might not be feasible at this stage).\nImplement a peer review system to provide more accurate and balanced grading.\nAccept the initial test results (14/14 scores) as the final results. While this may be a basic measure, it is at least consistent and reflective of the criteria we optimized our scripts for.\n\nWhat cannot be done, however, is ignoring the evident flaws in the evaluation system. Students invested weeks optimizing their scripts (from scores like 4/14 to 14/14) based on the visible tests, only to be blindsided by a system that ultimately did not function as intended.\nWhile I am not opposed to new evaluation systems or changes, it is essential that such systems work transparently and consistently to ensure fairness for all students.\nThank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your response.\nSincerely,\nAditya Gupta"

    "content": "Dear Tds team , @andrew @Bharathi @Milo ,\nI am writing to express my concerns regarding the evaluation of Project 2 for the TDS course. Several aspects of the grading process have raised serious issues of fairness, transparency, and academic integrity, which are causing undue stress among students.\nFirstly, the evaluation matrices appear to be biased and disproportionately harsh. For instance, even scripts that scored as high as 89 in visible test cases were unable to solve the hidden cases, with no explanation provided for the failure. This lack of feedback makes it impossible for students to understand or address their mistakes, leading to significant frustration.\nAdditionally, the overall scores do not seem to accurately reflect the quality or efficiency of the submitted scripts. Many students have put in substantial effort to write optimized and functional code, only to receive grades that undermine their hard work. The lack of transparency in how the final grades are determined further exacerbates this issue.\nThis project\u2019s grading has had an outsized impact on the overall course grade, jeopardizing the academic standing of many students. Such a disproportionate weight on one project, coupled with an unusually high level of complexity this term, has made it exceedingly difficult for students to achieve even a decent grade. This has resulted in feelings of humiliation and distress.\nI kindly request that the department reviews the evaluation process for Project 2, providing greater transparency in scoring, a more balanced weighting for grades, and constructive feedback on hidden test cases. This would ensure a fairer assessment of students\u2019 efforts and capabilities.\nI hope you will consider the concerns raised here and take the necessary steps to rectify the situation. I, along with my peers, am willing to discuss this matter further if required.\nThank you for your understanding.\nSincerely,\nAditya Gupta\nTDS Course Participant"

    "content": "\n\n\n 22f3002811:\n\nSeveral aspects of the grading process have raised serious issues of fairness, transparency, and academic integrity, which are causing undue stress among students.\n\n\nIt would be good to know what part of evaluation was not transparent. From what I have seen of the project, the problem statement, evaluation criteria and best practices were explained very clearly right from the start. Please check the github page for the evaluation criteria.\nNow specifically if I take your submission and check for what went wrong (use this link to see the detail) In fact I would say that the faculty has been more transparent in revealing results of each student with greater details.\n\n\nExplanation given by Carlton in another thread\nEDIT:\nIf you want to see the alignment, please check the reply that @carlton gave in a separate thread.\n\n\n\n\n 22f3002811:\n\nthe evaluation matrices appear to be biased and disproportionately harsh.\n\n\nI do understand that the evaluating matrices are hard/tough, but if you actually look at the skill sets being assessed, we are looking at:\n\nData Analysis skill sets\nDeployability skill sets\nPresentation skill sets\nPrompt Engineering skill sets\n\nI believe the materials that you have seen in the course in this term actually covers all these skill sets sufficiently to prepare you for the assessments. By any chance did you attend the TA session for Project 2? There were a lot of helpful pointers that were discussed by @carlton and @Jivraj\nIf I am not mistaken, there was also an extension to the due date so that it gives learners sufficient time to try out various solution approaches.\nAgain, in terms of support both the faculty and TAs were consistently responding to major queries in the forum and were also updating the FAQs when they encounter same type of query.\n\n\n\n 23f2005059:\n\nProj2 uses concepts which are not explicitly it\u2019s prerequisites.\n\n\nI believe the Project primarily needs the following skill sets:\n\nPython\nGit\nLLMs - Specifically the function calls and chat completions, both of which were detailed in the module\n\nThe only new knowledge that you need were on UV, for which the videos were provided along with the Project 2 statement. But even here there were sufficient support through the TA session and responses to the queries.\nFrom an administrative point of view, this project actually introduces you to the kind of problems that you might face when you are in a Data Science firm or when you are doing a real-life Data Science problem. And these are the skill sets that will help you to prove your credentials.\nEven if you look at the scores obtained by your peers, you can see that there are students who have done well in the project. Below is the distribution of scores:\nHistogram of P2 Score frequncies600\u00d7371 10.3 KB\n[This is very much in line with the typical curves that we get for Maths2 or Stats2 exams]\n\n\n\n 22f3002293:\n\nSo, people who took TDS in this term, including me, have to live with it,\n\n\nI believe every course is in its constant mode of improvement, and this is done so that the outcome aligns well with the learning goals set up for the course. Tools in Data Science is no exception, in fact this course that has to keep up with the changing landscape of tool usage and practices in the Industry, especially now that we see a greater focus among companies to hire students with skill sets that are tested in this project.\nHowever, if you are still doubtful of transparency part of the project, please do comment. In fact we could even open up a meet to listen to your concerns and see if we are able to address them."

    "content": "Thank you for your response to my earlier concerns. However, there are several points that remain unresolved, and I would appreciate further clarification and transparency on the following:\n\nUse of AI for Grading:\nRelying on AI for grading is inherently unfair, as manual evaluation and AI evaluation can produce significantly different results. Without a clear explanation of the AI\u2019s decision-making process, it is impossible to trust the fairness of the scores.\nEvaluation Script Issues:\nThe evaluation script seems to be flawed. For instance, even scripts scoring 14/14 in visible test cases end up receiving lower marks in the final evaluation. Additionally, the absence of any feedback mechanism renders the evaluation script practically useless. This lack of feedback also negates the value of live sessions since we cannot test the methods taught or determine which method is best for solving the problem.\nConfusing and Inconsistent Result Display:\nThe result page is confusing and inconsistent with the dashboard. The histogram graph appears unreliable, and the detailed results section is incomplete\u2014my roll number, for example, is missing entirely from this section, making it impossible to validate claims about a \u201cdetailed result.\u201d I request access to the code or methodology used for generating these results to understand the process better.\nDeadline Management:\nWhile an extension of the due date was granted, it was irrelevant given the already overwhelming number of submissions due on December 15. Additionally, the delayed release of the project closer to the end-term added unnecessary pressure on students, which was unfair and could have been avoided with better planning.\n\nThese issues raise serious questions about the fairness, transparency, and effectiveness of the evaluation process. I kindly request you address these concerns and provide a detailed explanation or take corrective measures to ensure a fair and transparent grading system.\nThe matter is not that we did not understand the grading system , the issue is that the entire grading system is unfair by it\u2019s design as the results it produce is not consistent.\nThank you for your time and attention to this matter."

    "content": "I am noting down my response to your concerns in the below post. @s.anand has publicly addressed some of these in his blog post\nSo you can read both our interpretations and take a call on whether you have received answers to all the concerns raised.\n\n\n\n 22f3002811:\n\nUse of AI for Grading:\nRelying on AI for grading is inherently unfair, as manual evaluation and AI evaluation can produce significantly different results. Without a clear explanation of the AI\u2019s decision-making process, it is impossible to trust the fairness of the scores.\n\n\nWhile I agree that AI is unreliable, but I believe this was made explicit right from the release of the problem statement itself that the reviewer will be an LLM. So this should not have been the time to raise this concern.\n\n\n\n 22f3002811:\n\nFor instance, even scripts scoring 14/14 in visible test cases end up receiving lower marks in the final evaluation.\n\n\nI think it was very well explained that the evaluation script just does a sanity check and is not the final word when it comes to final evaluation.\n\n\n\n 22f3002811:\n\nAdditionally, the absence of any feedback mechanism renders the evaluation script practically useless. This lack of feedback also negates the value of live sessions since we cannot test the methods taught or determine which method is best for solving the problem\n\n\nWhile I agree to the feedback related portion, I have this basic question. The AI token were shared with you to test out the code. Wouldn\u2019t you be able to get response from the LLM during the testing phase and get a response from it directly? I believe they didn\u2019t change the model significantly during the evaluation period, so there should not be too many variations to the response.\nAgain, I\u2019m not sure how this affects the value of live session. The Live sessions are kept so that any type of question can get addressed and is independent of whether you attempted the assignment or not. And I believe the forum was open for anyone to use, if in doubt, as I see both @carlton and @Jivraj answering most queries here. In fact Anand was also active in the P2 discussion thread clarifying the queries.\n\n\n\n 22f3002811:\n\nThe result page is confusing and inconsistent with the dashboard.\n\n\nI am totally with you here. But it is not hard to figure out. Let me break it down for you taking your case as an example. I followed the same process to understand the scoring process.\nScreen 1: Results student wise\nResult student wise1499\u00d7837 61.4 KB\nThe first thing to do is to search for your roll no (Simple Ctrl/Cmd+F) should suffice here.\nScreen 2:\nsearching given rollno1043\u00d7748 60.8 KB\nAnd when you click on your roll no id, you can see two things:\n\n\nOnly your results are seen\nindividual student result931\u00d7207 10.8 KB\nThe way I interpreted it was: You have scored 8.88 marks out of a total 28 marks that is possible, and the marks are based on 34 correct tests out of a possible 89.\nPersonal observations: The bar was deceiving (need to check what the div element was) and presence of legends would have made interpretation easier.\n\n\nThe URL changes for the selection\n\ni.e. for any student to directly check their results they can use https://sanand0.github.io/tds-2024-sep-project-2-results/#?id=<RollNo>\n\n\nThis direct URL would have made life a lot easier for all students. Definitely a feedback that I will be giving Anand.\nScreen 3: To check if my interpretation is correct, I clicked on the test tab now.\nAnd lo and behold I see detailed evaluation of 89 test cases (direct url in case you want to check).\nTests tab1188\u00d7853 63.8 KB\nScreen 4: Now that I have seen the test results, the next question was will the student know why their code failed in the test cases?? And to answer this click on the details tab and there you have details of each and every test along with the feedback.\nDetails of test results1657\u00d7808 116 KB\nHopefully, by now you would have figured out the direct URL for this.\nAs a complete outsider to the Project 2 implementation, it took me 5 minutes to figure this out, but the results.csv that Anand had shared in P2 thread helped a lot in interpretation and consolidation. But again, this was available along with result declaration.\n\n\n\n 22f3002811:\n\nI request access to the code or methodology used for generating these results to understand the process better.\n\n\nIf I am not mistaken, the evaluation script is already shared with all of you much well in advance (even before due date). This is the same that you used in your local evaluation. The only difference, if I understood the process correctly, is that it now run on a different server for the actual evaluation.\n\n\n\n 22f3002811:\n\nit was irrelevant given the already overwhelming number of submissions due on December 15. Additionally, the delayed release of the project closer to the end-term added unnecessary pressure on students, which was unfair and could have been avoided with better planning.\n\n\nAs an administrator, I will concur with one part of your grievance that the project release could have been planned a little better so that it did not end a week before the End terms. But having said that, I guess the team would have intimated you about the new dates well in advance during the term itself.\n\n\n\n 22f3002811:\n\nAs you are likely aware, this course carries the weightage of 3 credits and is designed to provide students with a brief overview of the tools used in data science. Given this, there is no reason to overly complicate a project that accounts for only 20% of the total grade.\n\n\nI am not sure where you obtained the goal from. But as stated in the course webpage\n\nThis practical course will teach students to use popular tools for sourcing data, transforming it, analyzing it, communicating these as visual stories, and deploying them in production. Pre-requisites: Python, HTML, JavaScript, Excel, data science basics\n\nSo I believe the Project is aligned with the course goals.\n\n\n\n 22f3002811:\n\nA balanced evaluation should aim to assess students\u2019 understanding of the concepts taught, not overwhelm them with disproportionately difficult requirements.\n\n\nSince I am neither a student nor a faculty/instructor/TA, I clearly see two parts to this argument:\nFrom a teacher\u2019s point of view the student should be provided with meaningful challenges so that learning is both sustainable and transferable. And this means that there are inherent hardships involved in the process. They will aim for the balance by ensuring there are enough opportunities for students to learn in the course. Especially in a course like TDS, this means lot more of hands on activities and assessments as there is very little to teach as concept here.\nHere is Anand\u2019s version of this\nFrom a students point of view, there should be something tangible that they can learn which can be used for their career (doesn\u2019t matter what path is chosen) and also optimizes their time and effort .\nNote: I think this is a fair expectation from the student and am not dismissing it entirely.\nSo when it comes to course like TDS, you will be looking at a fairly doable set of assignments and activities that do not eat into your other courses or activities.\nSo the point becomes, how do you define balanced? Here are some pointers from my side (While these are put in a question format, both instructors and students can adapt these questions in their own context and try to see if these are answered to the best of their abilities)\n\nAre the assessments assessing the intended skills?\nIs there clarity on the way the assessment is going to be implemented/administered?\nIs there a/multiple mechanisms for student to seek support and clarification both before and during the assessment?\nAre the students being nudged to plan and do the assessments?\n\nI hope you can use this as self-check for yourselves to see if these are getting answered satisfactorily.\nNow, if you still feel that grading system is not fair, happy to get on a call and discuss this."

    "content": "look man I don\u2019t want to argue but let me make it very simple for you , I don\u2019t have any problem with discussion , clarity or goal of the project , as a matter of fact I like challenges , I enjoyed this course more that any other course in this diploma but there is time for fun and there is a time for Marks .\nNow comes the only part where the main issue lies \u2026\nimage1889\u00d7986 101 KB\nthis is a screen shot of the final result of the final evaluation script ,\nNow take a close look at the fields these were the exact evaluation fields which were hidden for final evaluation which determined (ruined) my final score .\nNow just tell me how did the LLM evaluated my readme file such that it could not determine what headings my readme contained\nimage1116\u00d7838 77.4 KB\nOr how did it figured out that the charts I used are not relevant\n,you can see my full response in tds-project2/goodreads at main \u00b7 AdityaGuptaVarshney/tds-project2 \u00b7 GitHub\nNow To explore alternative evaluation methods\nif peer review had been used, I believe it is reasonable to estimate that my final score would have ranged between 80-90%. This aligns with the initial evaluation script, which scored my submission at 89% (14/14).\n(Even you basic evaluation script which by the way used llm to give a final grade evaluated my script 89 percent ) ,\n\n(14/14 to be exact)  because of which most of the students including me were confused and thought that they have cracked the project and would get a decent grade \u2026 this was the transparency error\nNow finally tell me how can you justify it\n\n\nHow can you justify the transformation of 89 % (basic but still relevant) score to a mere (41%) after the final evaluation (which is not working as intended hence the consistency and integrity error)\n\n\nHow can you justify 41 % when with peer review i could have got 90 % easily\n\n\nHow can you justify the degradation of our final grade point from (B to C ) .\n\n\nProposed Solutions:\n\nReevaluate all submissions using a new and fair evaluation script (though I understand this might not be feasible at this stage).\nImplement a peer review system to provide more accurate and balanced grading.\nAccept the initial test results (14/14 scores) as the final results. While this may be a basic measure, it is at least consistent and reflective of the criteria we optimized our scripts for.\n\nWhat cannot be done, however, is ignoring the evident flaws in the evaluation system. Students invested weeks optimizing their scripts (from scores like 4/14 to 14/14) based on the visible tests, only to be blindsided by a system that ultimately did not function as intended.\nWhile I am not opposed to new evaluation systems or changes, it is essential that such systems work transparently and consistently to ensure fairness for all students.\nThank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your response.\nSincerely,\nAditya Gupta"

    "content": "image1918\u00d71071 148 KB\nDear @carlton,\nThe page you referenced regarding grading was not accessible or known to exist until I raised concerns about the grading system for Project 2. If it did exist earlier, there were no clear instructions provided on how to navigate to it.\nHowever, my primary concern is not just about the grading process but the inherent flaws and biases within the grading system itself.\nGiven the complexities, it is unrealistic to expect any model to consistently and accurately grade the output of another LLM in a manner that is both fair and transparent. The reliance on such a system for Project 2, which contributes 20% to the final grade without any bonus considerations, is fundamentally flawed and irresponsible.\nThis approach raises significant concerns about the fairness and reliability of the evaluation process, especially for a project that carries such weight in determining the overall grade. I urge you to reconsider the methods and mechanisms employed to ensure a more equitable assessment for all students."

    "content": "Sir, I think an evaluator script which reflects the final results with atleast 80% accuracy is a must for an assignment of this nature. The script contents may be hidden but it should be able to evaluate. This is very logical because it acts like a feedback mechanism in implementing and improving what we are taught in the course or sessions, without this it is not possible to learn anything as we are interacting with an ai model for evaluation for the first time. We are not capable to make a proj good enough in the first try itself, we need some feedback even if we have a lot of support from the live sessions. Live sessions and guidelines will only work for those already familiar with what works and what doesn\u2019t. How can beginners be expected to excel in this proj without a evaluation script that can check our submission in a similar way the final evaluation script checks it.\nThis is the only long term solution I can propose for future terms. I have lost hope for this term, unless my marks are doubled they will not have any effect on my grade.\nThe outrage on discourse happened only because of gap in expectation put by evaluation script and reality on dashboard\nI hope I have put my point across, thank you for reading."

Many of us diligently followed the instructions provided, especially those shared on the GitHub page, only to find that the actual grading criteria seemed unclear at the time of submission.\nFurthermore, when running the evaluation code locally, several students, including myself, consistently obtained scores between 80 to 100 marks. However, the dashboard reflects significantly lower marks\u2014for instance, I received only 15. This inconsistency raises questions about the evaluation process and its alignment with the guidelines we followed.\nThis lack of clarity has left many students dissatisfied with their marks, as the results do not align with the effort invested and the feedback received during project evaluation sessions. I believe it would be beneficial for the course team to review this issue and provide more transparent grading rubrics for future projects.\ns.anand\ncarlton\nandrew"

    "content": "Same concerns regarding the project\nthe course itself is very diverse and each one of us are not working professionals who already have got an early hand in the tech field\nmany of us have just passed 12th grade a year ago and still we are constantly trying our best adhering to course syllabus\nAs it was already mentioned the project is hard and not something everyone has done, we still took the challenge and used our brains\nbut still, experienced people always will have edge over us on these type of projects. There has to be a common line drawn which is helpful to all age category students, for learning aspects and marks evaluation\nor a brief regarding the project.\nLike I heard the term API calls, tokens etc. for the first time and it was hard for me to crack all the terminologies and go ahead with the project\nI hope there will be some improvement regarding the pedagogy of this course."

Despite putting in significant effort, dedicating extensive time, and trying every possible solution, the results we achieved were not satisfactory. This has not only impacted our grades but has also caused considerable stress.\nWhile we appreciate the learning opportunities this course has provided and have gained valuable knowledge and skills, the low marks on this project are affecting our overall academic performance. As grades play an essential role in our degree progression, we kindly request you to review the grading or do something needful."

It\u2019s something you haven\u2019t done before. (Nor most people in the world.)\nSo I strongly urge you to start early!\nPlease use this thread for any questions.\nYou\u2019ll learn a lot of new things. Enjoy the journey!\nUPDATE: 7 Dec 2024. The WIP evaluation script is at tools-in-data-science-public/project2 at tds-2024-t3-project2-wip \u00b7 sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public \u00b7 GitHub\nUPDATE: 12 Dec 2024. Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWhen is Project 2 due? Before Mon 16 Dec 2024,3:30 pm IST.\nWhere do I submit? https://forms.gle/r2sNJvGicxrhE9mYA\nCan I use my own OpenAI API key? Yes\nWhere should I store the token? In the AI_PROXY environment variable. Don\u2019t commit your token.\nWhat if I ran out of the $2 credit on my token? We\u2019ve increased it to $5 for everyone. You will not get more. Borrow from friends if required.\nHow do I check how much credit I have used so far? Every response has a monthlyCost field. Keep that below 5.0.\nWon\u2019t passing images to OpenAI cost too much? Use \"detail\": \"low\" to reduce it.\nWhat should my folder structure be?\n\nautolysis.py\ngoodreads/README.md\ngoodreads/*.png\nhappiness/README.md\nhappiness/*.png\nmedia/README.md\nmedia/*.png\n\n\nHow should I run my autolysis.py? uv run autolysis.py /path/to/input.csv\nWhere should I save the README.md and PNG files? In the current working directory.\nHow can I check my submission? Use the WIP Project 2 Evaluation Script.\nWhere are the results of this stored?\n\nLinux/Mac: ~/.local/share/tds-sep-24-project-2/results.csv\nWindows: %LOCALAPPDATA%\\tds\\tds-sep-24-project-2\\results.csv\n\n\nLLMs are error prone. Should my code retry on failure? Yes. E.g. use a library like tenacity.\nWill you evaluate the code multiple times and take an average? No. Just once.\nHow long can my code run? Max 120 seconds.\nWhat if I get CLONE FAILED ... returned non-zero exit status 128.? Your GitHub repo URL is wrong or your repo is private.\nWhich datasets will you evaluate? The project mentions \u201cone of the datasets you submitted\u201d. We\u2019ll run uv run autolysis.py on either goodreads.csv, happiness.csv, or media.csv, randomly, and evaluate it. We will also evaluate it on 2 secret datasets.\nI get a No module named .... Read the uv reading material\nI get a HTTP 429 error. OpenAI is tired. Retry.\nI get a different score each evaluation. LLMs give different results each time. Make your code and prompts more robust.\n\nUPDATE: 14 Dec 2024. More FAQs\n\nBut my code works on my system\u2026 It needs to work via the evaluate script too. This project teaches you portable and deployable coding.\nBut it worked last time\u2026 APIs are unreliable. Learn how to handle that, e.g. via retries, caching, timeouts, etc.\nBut I got a different score last time\u2026 LLMs are not deterministic. Learn how to handle that, e.g. via robust prompts.\nBut my code times out\u2026 Shorten your prompts. Reduce the number of LLM requests. Pray for luck.\nWhat\u2019s the max total from the evaluation script? 14 when you run it. When I run it, it\u2019ll add 2 extra datasets taking the total to 20. (Plus 8 bonus marks for originality and 4 for wow factor. Finally, normalization.)\nWhat if the code evaluation gives me contradictory feedback? The final code evaluation script is a secret. It\u2019ll be far more granular. Use the evaluation output as a guide but focus on writing good code.\nHow do I handle No module named ...? Read the Project 2 reading material on uv\nShould I pip install my dependencies? No. Read the Project 2 reading material on uv\nWhere should I save my generated README.md and PNG files?. In the current directory, NOT the script directory, nor the data directory.\nHow do I handle Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer...? Use http://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1 as your OPENAI_API_BASE when using the openai library with AIProxy\nI have a Readme.md but the evaluation script script says I dont. File names will be evaluated case-sensitively. Create a README.md and *.png in exactly that case.\n\n\nUPDATE: 15 Dec 2024. Second submission evaluation.\nI\u2019ve evaluated 343 Project 2 submissions starting around 4 pm IST today.\nOf these, 151 got 3/3, and these are PROBABLY OK. Others may copy your code. You might improve & test it locally for uniqueness and push before the deadline.\nThe remaining 192 submissions are not OK.\nThe evaluation is based on this evaluation script: tools-in-data-science-public/project2 at tds-2024-t3 \u00b7 sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public \u00b7 GitHub\nThe results are at: TDS Sep 2024 - Project 2 Evaluation 2024-12-15 - Google Drive\nresults.csv has the status of the submission checks for each student. If your ID is not here, then you have not submitted with your IITM email. Please submit again.\nlogs/ has the logs, i.e. your code output (if there was any). I run the evaluator 2-3 times since I ran out of tokens. So some of you may see the output of two runs.\nThe top problems I see are:\n\nSaving files in the script or data directory instead of the current working directory.\nNot using script metadata for uv, or trying to install via pip\nScript runs forever. NOT due to LLMs, but waiting for interactive visualizations, starting HTTP servers, etc.\nAI Proxy token is not set up correctly.\n\nThese are classic deployment mistakes. Please fix them.\nSome of your repos are private. I guess you know what you\u2019re doing.\nI won\u2019t be able to run more evaluations before the deadline, nor revert on this thread, given travel. I suggest you run the evaluation script (preferably without Python in the path, with the data in a faraway directory) to check if your code works.\nTDS 2024 Sep Project 2 Results\nView Project 2 results.\nThis is the evaluation process.\nAnalyzing the results.csv will be interesting. Please do share your analysis and learnings.\nFAQ\n\nBut I get different results locally. ANS: Your code ran differently in the test environment. LLMs and environments are not deterministic. Write code more robustly.\nWhat\u2019s fatal: could not read Username for 'https://github.com': terminal prompts disabled? ANS: Your repo is private.\nWhat\u2019s missing autolysis.py? ANS: Your script was not named autolysis.py and present in the root folder. Maybe it had a different name or was in a different folder.\nWhy\u2019s my README.md or *.png missing? ANS: Your script didn\u2019t generate them, or saved them in a wrong location.\nWhy do output: wage_theft.csv, output: house_rent.csv get 0 points? ANS: They are not part of the evaluation. They\u2019re just an informational check.\nWhat is code_hacking? ANS: The code has content that nudges the LLM towards higher code quality scores? This does not affect your score, but re-runs the evaluation.\nWhat is output_hacking? ANS: The output has content that nudges the LLM towards higher output quality scores. That gives you a tiny bonus and re-runs the evaluation.\nWhy does it praise my score and still give me 0? ANS: The prompt instructs it to always tell you what\u2019s good AND bad, irrespective of the score.\nHow was the code diversity bonus calculated? ANS: Using the % overlap (Jaccard similarity) with previous submissions. Bonus = Your marks * (1 - overlap) * 8 / 20\nWhat about the \u201cEngaging and interesting\u201d bonus? ANS: None of the responses blew my mind. (Oh, there are very good ones, no doubt.) So I didn\u2019t award any for this.\n\nThis concludes the Project 2 evaluation.\nFantastic work, everyone!!"

    "content": "Hello Prof. Anand,\nIf, as an option, autolysis.py executes python code that the LLM sends back (as an alternative to and/or in addition to function callbacks),  I presume there will be necessary checks in the evaluator to terminate the program should it take (way) too long to execute (say, the arbitrary code from the LLM has an infite loop) and/or hits some memory thresholds (among other factors).\nWill the evaluator retry running the program a few times (should such scenarios occur) to see if it runs successfully in one of those retries? Or, is it just one execution - either success or failed case?\nIn regards to the code/generated artifacts review, will the score be a simple average of the score received from the LLM by sending the code/generated artifacts to the LLM a few times (because there may be (perhaps, slight) variations in the score and/or hallucinations, presumably)? Or, just one time invocation of the LLM?\nThank you."

    "content": "I have some concerns regarding the TDS project. In order to analyze the data as specified, we are uncertain about the type of dataset we may encounter. Therefore, we must conduct a generic analysis that includes summary statistics, counting missing values, correlation matrices, outlier detection, clustering, and hierarchical detection, among other techniques. Additionally, it has been suggested to consult the language model (LLM) about the dataset by providing details such as the file name and column names to gain a better understanding of the dataset and to inquire about the types of analyses that can be performed on it.\nMy uncertainty lies in whether we will instruct the LLM to select the appropriate analysis methods from the functions we have predefined. For instance, a specific dataset may be effectively analyzed using correlation and time series analysis, and we have already established six to seven analytical functions, including these two. Will the LLM only recommend these two functions, or do we expect it to suggest the most suitable analyses for the dataset and also provide the corresponding code? If that is the case, how will we store the results generated by the code? For example, if it produces a correlation table with a heat map, how can we save that table for future narrative reporting and ensure that the generated heat map is saved as a PNG file? My research indicates that while I can generate and run the code instantaneously, I am unable to utilize the output for further analysis.\nAnd, if we generate three or four charts, do we need to save all of them individually or combine them into a single image? This is particularly important as the requirements specify that there should be one image corresponding to each dataset.\nDue to certain modification in doubt I have modified and reposted it"

I am not against anyone but because of this evaluation my result is lagging behind and I got very less marks. I am attaching the images with this.

    "content": "Dear TDS Team,\nThroughout the course, from the foundation/qualifiers stage, we have been trained to rely on timely email notifications for upcoming events, exams, and other key activities. We receive multiple reminders for assignment submissions, SCTs, exam registrations, hall tickets, live sessions, etc. For exams specifically, we have always received hall tickets with proper prior notification.\nHowever, for the TDS ROE, the only email we received was on the day of the exam itself, asking us to appear for it without any prior intimation. This lack of communication creates significant challenges, especially for working professionals, who often need to plan their schedules well in advance. Such uncoordinated planning is not feasible unless one happens to be unoccupied on that day by sheer luck.\nThis is the first exam conducted without hall tickets which I was not even aware of this or no information available about this in any form.\nIn online course, proper communication and timely reminders are absolutely critical to ensure participants can attend the exams effectively.\nI see this as an operational failure rather than an issue of students forgetting to set reminders for important dates.\nI completely missed this exam due to a lack of awareness about the date and time. May be the case with most of students who missed the exam. Due to this, I have direct impact on my grade."

(i.e. Before Mon 16 Dec 2024, 3:30 pm Indian Standard Time)\nNOTE: This is the final deadline. There will not be any extension whatsoever beyond this deadline. This applies even if you face any technical issues, as this is already a generous extension. Do not wait for the last minute to submit your projects. We will not  consider any technical/non-technical reasons for failure to submit as there was plenty of time given to get it resolved beforehand. This is a grace extension. Treat it as such and submit early.\nYour friendly TDS team,\n"

    "content": "429 errors are sometimes due to the Open AI having to deal with too many requests. They recently launched their global Santa model and I expect in the run up to Christmas there will be huge load on their servers. Just try again later. Though there is no guarantee about this. Another thing to note is that use evaluate.py sparingly. It uses your token and it takes up a lot of context tokens to run (it includes your codes, outputs, readme and the evaluation script and prompts for context). So only use it to check your final (bug free) solution. The script itself is never going to be a guarantee of your score, because its still being refined and fine tuned, Its just to see if everything is working correctly and do give you a rough idea of how your submission is scored.\nKind regards"

    "content": "@s.anand @carlton I\u2019ve received review email a few minutes ago and realized that the one of the two repositories do not have code (the other one has the scraping code but not the code for the project questions).\nSince Prof. Anand mentioned in this thread that code can be uploaded in the interim and given the fact that the code carries 50% weightage - I will defer my reviews in the interim until a reasonable enough period where it will be a fair expectation for the students to read this discourse thread and upload the code to their repositories. Specifically so, because the project description mentioned that the code is optional, however, the evaluation note mentions it carries 50% weightage overall.\nOther reviewers may not defer their reviews and could submit the Google forms rightaway today (without students getting a fair chance to read this post and upload their code).\nThat could be a problem (once scores are declared) since many students may ask that they did upload their code and yet received 0 score on that (since the reviewers had already submitted the Google forms before they had a chance to upload their code). And add to that the fact that a Google form once submitted cannot be reopened and resubmitted.\n(1) [Probably an operations question] Is there a reasonable day that reviewers should expect the students to upload their code and then the reviews should commence?\n(2) Is there any evaluation guideline how to evaluate the case when the scraping code has been provided but not the code to answer the project questions? Consider the fact that - scraping definitely need code (as far as I can tell), but the project questions may well be answered using say, just a spreadsheet for example."

    "content": "Please refer to the above response.\nThat is the official position. That being said, the evaluation script is a little forgiving. It searches all the relative locations for your files. Still you should follow the official guidelines (because the evaluation script is just a guide and was provided due to popular request. It is however constantly being updated and debugged). If you follow the guidelines you will be safe because even if the script is wrong you have a basis for an appeal. However if you do not follow the published guidelines and write your code to the quirks of the script then you will have no basis for an appeal if the script is corrected to adhere to the guidelines.\nThink about this. Most students do not look at the script or read these discourse posts. So they will be following the guidelines (which is the minimum we expect). So therefore my advice has always remained consistent. Follow the guidelines. Hope that gives clarity. Any goof ups on our end then resolves in your favour.\nKind regards"

The average price of tickets is Rs.9,048. The dataset contains basic information about each flight (such as date, time, departure airport, arrival airport, price, departure time, arrival time, route, and total stops).\n\n\u2026 but Akhilesh Tilotia used to advise the ministry of civil aviation, is a keen open-data enthusiast, and might have worked on this problem. There\u2019s a good chance he has an official private dataset or knows where to get one. Please feel free to reach out and mention me as a reference."

Though I have gone through 6weeks of course lecture videos, I am not fully aware of the usage of ChromeDevTools, Bash, Github etc. It will be useful to understand the core principles of the tools, if the course lecture documents with respect to TDS is uploaded in the IITM site. Hope this comment is taken in a positive way."

    "content": "Term 1: German. In my first term at IIT Madras (1992), I took German 1 with Prof D Subramanian.\nThe first words D.Subs said when he entered the room were, \u201cWer sind Sie?\u201d\nI had no clue what he was talking about. Nor did the others. After individually asking about a dozen students, Ashok Krishna replied, \u201cIch bin Ashok.\u201d (He knew German.)\nThe rest of the term proceeded in the same vein. He threw us in the deep end, spoke only German, and I ended up with a \u201cD\u201d and learning very little German. Ashok Krishna thrived in that course.\nTerm 2: German. In took German 2 with Mrs Schindler in the next term. The experience was very different. She explained each word. She had us listen to tapes in German. It was very relaxed.\nI ended up with a \u201cB\u201d and learning very little German. (I\u2019m not good with human languages.) But many others enjoyed it.\nWhich is better? I\u2019m not sure. I think gentle courses are good for beginners and tough ones for advanced student, but classes usually have a mix of both. Aptitude and interest help, too.\nTerm 1: Physics. Prof. PC Deshmukh handled our first physics course. (He was the one responsible for renaming Mardi Gras \u201cSaarang\u201d.) Our class felt the exams were too tough. My friend Badri and I explained this to him. \u201cWell, you two should be lobbying for even tougher exams,\u201d PCD said. \u201cThat\u2019ll benefit smarter guys like you more.\u201d\nIIMB Term 1: Statistics. My classmate Athreya Sampath was a class representative for statistics (a tough subject.) Going against tradition, he lobbied for a tougher test. He was almost lynched afterwards.\nWhich is better? I\u2019m not sure. An easy exam is good for student grades and morale. A tough exam is good for college reputation and advanced students. Classes usually need both.\n\nIn short, I have no clue.\nStudents who take this course learn several topics 3 months.\nFaculty like me haven\u2019t managed to learn how to calibrate course content or exams even after 3 years.\nBut, I\u2019m learning. Thanks to you.\nSo please keep the feedback coming. We\u2019ll keep improving. And thanks for putting up with us!"

    "content": "The examples you mentioned involve optional subjects, you chose german but in this course TDS is a compulsory subject. Besides, IITs and IIMs are already meant for the smartest of the smartest, whereas this course is meant to be accessible to anyone, with no background knowledge required.\nI don\u2019t think this course is particularly hard, but it is definitely more time intensive and involved than other courses at this level. It does NOT feel like a 3 credit course in terms of workload. Issues that I think are quite apparent are-\n\nPre-requisite knowledge required - Some of us students pick this course based on the description in the BS degree website, and only after doing week 0 do we realize how underequipped we are. The course description should be updated to reflect these requirements, and the necessary pre/co requisite courses should be added to the list.\nOperational issues - Discourse is filled with them, I think most of these will be resolved in time.\n"

Personally, I\u2019m enjoying the pace, content and the learnings.\nFor the issue raised, I suggest we work on pre-reqs. As I see it, two ways to do this -\n\ncollaborate internally with other teams to introduce these concepts alongside. For instance, MAD1 can introduce GitHub, devtools; BDM can provide overview about LLMs; programming aspects are already covered at this stage so no change(python/colab. Note# TDS has no pre-requisite and students may not have taken these subjects yet. That brings us to next point\nTDS focused independent pre-reqs. In this direction, we already have Module 1, Everyday Tools. My suggestion would be to strengthen this -\n\n\na) categorise the content/videos. A brief on why are we learning these, for which section/purpose, and to what outcome. Today, they are just embedded videos\nb) Introduce PAs, as in other subjects. Say one dedicated PA on GitHub, another on LLM, and may be one more on devtools (totally based on the coverage required for the subject)\n\nAdditionally -\n\nunlike other courses, this one is very fast-paced and ever-changing. You may want to consider additional staffing, comm efforts, and increased frequency of sessions.\nTo optimise the pace and redistribute some of the load, I suggest we revisit Module 6 (Geo/Network), both on content (misaligned with existing flow of \u201ctools\u201d) and sequence (may be after Module 8?). How about we introduce this as an optional Module?\n\nThank you"

    "content": "First of all, I\u2019d like to thank Prof. Anand and the teaching assistants for this course. This course is industry relevant, immersive, frequently updated and the content is extremely valuable. The projects and the ROE are creative, engaging and interesting. Being unique in each term, a significant amount of preparation and deliberation have gone into creating and publishing the tests.\nI would suggest not to alter the structure of the course (e.g. not to reduce the content but if possible, make this course a 4 credit course by adding 4 weeks of additional content in the future terms) because by the end of this course, a student will know an assortment of tools to choose from for a given data science problem statement.\nA few suggestions (please note: they are in response only to Prof. Anand\u2019s note and do not refer to any other note in this thread):\nFrom a student\u2019s standpoint:\n\nStudents who have already completed MLP, BDM, BA, MAD1/2, DBMS courses from the program will find this course relatively simpler. So if it is feasible on a student\u2019s part, one option is to take this course after one has completed some of these courses because they will already have a reasonable grasp on ML libraries, javascript (TypeScript/ReactJS/VueJS/nodejs if I am not mistaken) plus SQL (as part of DBMS course). However, there are students who are just taking the diploma course (and do not neccessarily study MAD1/2, DBMS). In terms of co-requisites, for anyone who is pursuing a diploma in Data Science (and not diploma in programming), having MLP as a co-requisite will help.\nIt will be helpful if number of courses in a term is chosen based on one\u2019s available bandwidth (whether one can spend that many hours/week as indicated in the course description page per course times the number of subjects chosen). Speaking from a personal experience, this is my first term in this program and with 4 courses (2 of them being math courses), I haven\u2019t been able to complete some of the TA sessions in TDS throughout all the weeks in this course, so I believe, unless this point is taken care of by a student (at the beginning of each term), the material (in any course) can get quickly overwhelming only because one does not have enough time to complete all the material published in a particular week,\n\nFrom a course standpoint (please ignore any if they have already been explored or deliberated on before and were deemed infeasible (from an operations standpoint or otherwise)):\n\n\nPlease check the feasibility of introducing gamification in couple of foundational modules (say, for example, a sandbox wherein a student can debug through a set of 15-20 html/javascript/css/python - calibrated questions of progressively increasing difficulty). The code can have some deliberate errors, for example. A marginal bonus may be added to the GA score.\n\n\nAs a precursor to above, I think a few additional videos on the following topics will be helpful in setting the context for the material that follows:\n\n\n\nHTML/CSS/Javascript and Python debugging foundations (debugging using a visual debugger as opposed to log statements)\nTools to view data in transit in a data transformation pipeline (for instance, additional coverage on tools such as Data Wrangler)\nConcept of an API - essentials of an API, how to debug GET/POST requests using a visual software such as Postman will help someone who is familiar with Python (assuming everyone in this course is) but is not familiar (yet) with the concepts of an API.\n\n\nPlease check the feasibility of introducing a TDS Wiki page (say, on Github) with curated, byte sized tips and tricks (the key here is bite sized nuggets of information, all collated in one location for ease of reference - one inclusion criteria, let\u2019s say something that could be read and understood in under 5 minutes by most - highly useful, yet simple techniques, with snippets of code inline, for example \u201chow to show progress bar for a for loop in python using tqdm() as demonstrated in one of the course videos\u201d). Topics in the Wiki could include (among others):\n\n\nGeneral debugging techniques (Web technologies (JS/html/css) or Python - for example, in a format similar to dev-tips)\nData wrangling techniques - how to think of interesting ways of transforming data (say, why and how one combines dataframes to get to the data needed to solve a problem - techniques (through examples) on how does one break down a data related problems into sub-problems, what\u2019s the thoughprocess involved in such operations, what is the standard approach of debugging etc.)\nPrompt engineering techniques (for example, what are some of the creative ways of using LLM as a coding, debugging, automation and creative assistance)\nVS Code tips and tricks (examples, multi cursor editing, how to create snippets of code for reuse, how to use AI completion, Codeium for example)\n\nPull requests can be invited and, as an option, a marginal bonus awarded for contributions.\n\n\nThe TA sessions that I have watched so far covers lot of concepts and are well presented - please verify if it is possible to condense the sessions on web scraping (html, cookies, xml, for example) which are more than 2 hours long into condensed videos (say, in the 20-30 minutes timeframe).\n\n\nPlease verify if concept of Teams will work in the context of the course. Since the data science program is (almost) entirely online, one of the challenges a section of students face is having a quick, face to face conversation with an expert (at a mutually agreed upon time) when they have something blocking their progress (this is in sharp contrast to an offline program or working in the industry). The teaching assistants in this course have helped immensely in terms of answering questions and conducting TA sessions where they have answered specific questions students have. I think, this concept may be extended by forming teams say a group of 2-3 students (with varying experience levels - one of them preferably with industry experience) who group together (over a call for a predefined interval of time) periodically (say, a few times in a month) and have a one on one conversations on anything that is blocking their progress (in terms of prerequisites one should know) or just general guidance.\nHaving said so, the biggest downside that I see of institutionalizing teams is that such a channel may quickly degrade to a channel that is leveraged only to finish assignments and projects by exchanging code (without necessarily spending time in understanding the code and the related concepts)  - that defeats the whole purpose of using a channel to only receive general guidance. Concept of Teams may work where a significant portion (say 80% or more of the overall score) is proctored. With 70% of this course\u2019s score being unproctored, I think a concept that works so well in the industry (the mentor concept), will quickly deteriorate to being a mechanism to just score more marks. However, I am listing the concept anyways.\n\n"

The purpose of putting the dates at multiple places is to ensure that students are well aware of the dates at the start of the term and make themselves available.\nAdditionally, since you have posted in Discourse, there was a separate post on this 10 days before, which was updated on 16 Nov -\n\n\n\nOfficial Announcement: Important ROE Details [Updated 16th Nov 18.02pm] Tools in Data Science\n\n\n    Hi all, \n[Update 16th Nov 18:02pm] \nDo I need an AI Proxy Token? \nYES (ignore previous update). Everyone will get an allowance of 660,000 Tokens. It should be more than enough for the exam. \nHow will I access the ROE? \nAn email will be sent with the exam link. The link will be accessible before the exam, but the questions will load only when the exam starts. \nWill I be able to check my answers? \nEveryones favourite green Check Answers button is back!

The python OPPEs cannot interfere because those are for Foundation students and no one in TDS should be a foundation student.\nSo there is no conflict of schedule. The ROE is in the afternoon at 1pm. Furthermore these dates were given right at the beginning of the term by the Operations Team itself and therefore is 0% possibility of moving them as many students are employed and thus prepare their appointments and holidays around the exam dates announced at the beginning of the term.\nKind Regards"

    "content": "Hi @carlton,\nWith regards to this PYQ set,\nDataset 1 Question 5\nFind the organization (as identified by the orgname tag) that has applied for the most patents? If more than one organization have filed same number of patents, write them in alphabetically increasing order with comma separation. (Please do not put space between commas)\nIf you check the answersheet, \u201cNA\u201d has been mentioned as the answer for Question 5 for majority of the datasets. However, NA (Not Applicable) is not an organization name. I understand that this answersheet may not have the \u2018final\u2019 final answers (post discussions/feedback from students who took the previous term exams), however, how does one make a decision on whether to skip (or include) missing tags/data when not explicitly stated in the question so because one can argue either ways that \u2018NA\u2019 is (or isn\u2019t) the answer for Question 5 (as an example) - so in this case missing data should have been included in the calculations. So will such clarifications be addressed via:\nCase 1:  the discourse thread for the ROE (assuming there will be one thread for the ROE), or\nCase 2: One can assume if the answer one has calculated and inputted in the textbox and verifies through the \u201cCheck\u201d button - if that says, it is correct (for example, NAs and \u2018nan\u2019 are answers in the answerset shared for this PYQ), then that is, in fact, the final answer.\nPlease review and advise.\nQuestion 5\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nPhilip Morris Products S.A.\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nSOCIETE DES PRODUITS NESTLE S.A.\nNA"

Please explore other edge cases including possibility of multiple pieces of data being merged to a single field in the generated json where ideally (a manual review should tell) it should have been mapped to multiple fields in the json instead.\nAlthough it is possible to eyeball through the entire dataset (which is just around 20 records) manually in a few minutes and verify if any of the cases above is true, you may want to run the input data through two LLMs (say, chatgpt versus Claude Sonnet (or any other)) and then do a diff compare on the two generate json files (say, using a diff utility in VS Code) to see if there is any minor diff that it shows (although like I said, since the dataset is so small, a cross LLM comparison is just an overkill for this particular scenario - you can try this as an option only if you\u2019re running short of time because part of the objective of this question and the next question is being able to spot where the AI went wrong in the first question, feed in all the findings/errors/ommisions  to the AI so the AI generates a (near) error free json in the next question)."

In the first iteration, in my dataset, the AI (ChatGpt4-o mini) errored in merging two pieces of data into one field Role: \u201cEngineer at Tech Dynamics\u201d whereas it really should have splitted this into two fields Role: \u201cEngineer\u201d and org: \u201cTech Dynamics\u201d. It\u2019s near impossible to know beforehand whether AI will (or will not) error out on any nuances. In other words, it is near impossible to feed in the \u2018perfect\u2019 prompts on the get go. After  a manual review and sharing those feedback to the AI on where it messed up in the first question, it gets (way) better in the second iteration (as far as I recall, I did not make any changes to the json in the second question and the validator outputted the correct code in the first try)."

On my end, I\u2019ve ensured that:\n\nThe embeddings api invocation matches the approach shown in the colab notebook shared in the Week 5  \u201cLLM Topic modeling\u201d lecture.\nChecked the case of the word and ensured there are no leading or trailing spaces\nThe length of the returned embeddings array matches the one specified in the question (e.g. 1536 as in the screenprint)\nSaved the embeddings in a csv and (as an additional check) verified the number of values greater than the specified number matches the one calculated in the code.\n\nSo, it appears that the answerset (or answersets) may have a \u201coff-by-one\u201d error (in case this is a repeat of a previous term question, if there are any changes made in the internals of the embeddings api on OpenAI\u2019s end and the embeddings returned (in the previous terms and now) just differ by a tiny little bit (pair-by-pair), but then, I am just speculating and very well could be wrong).\nWill debug further in case you confirm that the answer does lie in the options list (as specified in the question). I am done with the remaining questions in Week 5 and for this specific question, for now, I just marked the closest answer and submitted the GA."

I realized you\u2019ve already responded to a similar question.\n[Feature request] May be the GA page (for all subjects, of course) can have an announcements section (similar to codeforces). (Wherever applicable) it will be much easier to locate the required information/addendums related to any questions if there is such a section added to the GA page.\nThanks.\n\n\n\n\nWeek5 question no 6 Tools in Data Science\n\n\n    Hi Tarika, \nIf you choose the answer closest to the calculation, you will still get the correct answer. \nThe method to find the closest answer is to find the absolute difference between the option and your calculation. That choice will be the correct one. \nThe reason for the slight difference 10^{-3} or smaller is because the vectors get tweaked by openAI from time to time to improve their models. \nWe have validated the whole answer set and found that if students mark the closest answer it will \u2026\n  \n\n"

That choice will be the correct one.\nThe reason for the slight difference 10^{-3} or smaller is because the vectors get tweaked by openAI from time to time to improve their models.\nWe have validated the whole answer set and found that if students mark the closest answer it will still be the correct answer.\nKind regards"

Our goal is to make the restitution as painless as possible but also fair to those that submitted their assignments early. If you submitted early the full assignment we will still consider it for grading (aka you filled up all the answers).\n[UPDATE: 31 Oct 2024]\nThe requirement for end term eligibility will be dropped from best 3 of first 5\nto best 2 of first 5 graded assignments.\nLikewise, the best 4 of 7 graded assignments will be considered for graded assignment score for the T value.\nPlease note Project is separate from Graded Assignments. Project is not part of the eligibility requirements nor is it part of the GA score calculation. Project has its own weight and contribution to the T score.\nWe will inform you of the resolution in a couple of days time. We are sorry for the inconvenience. Please prepare for your upcoming quiz and all the best for it.\nKind regards"

So most likely, here is what happened:\n(a) The verifier just groups the languages and the associated counts and hence, language=empty wins (In your dataset)\n(b) Why it does not happen for other datasets then? I checked my dataset and could see that Javascript had ~5k records and language=blank had ~3k. So in my case got the right answer without thinking of this edge scenario (just a pandas value counts check). If it had been the other way round (e.g. more blanks than javascript in the language column), I don\u2019t know how to solve this except perhaps inputting blank as the answer and see if that works.  Even if blank had been accepted as an answer in the portal, not sure if the backend verifier (if there are additional, fine grained validations that happen there) would have accepted blank as the answer though."

This also leads to errors. (remove the .git in the submission on project page) Also mentioned in earlier discourse threads.\nThirdly, if you did not scrape the data correctly and it does not have the expected number of users then it will also throw the same error.\nKind regards"

Our backend data shows that expected submissions were largely inline with past terms. In other words Diwali made little statistically significant difference. As aspiring data scientists we should be careful with our words we use when we make statements.\nKind regards"

I had submitted my answers via the form and made a public GitHub repository well before the deadline, and I ensured that all responses were correct. However, due to a technical issue, it seems the form did not recognize my GitHub link, and as a result, all my answers have been marked as incorrect.\nAfter contacting the IITM Support Team via email, they suggested I bring this matter to the Discourse forum so that the instructors can review it directly. I would greatly appreciate it if someone could look into this issue and advise on how to resolve it.\nThank you very much for your time and assistance. Reply contains the link to the screenshot and pdf for proof of submission before deadline and that I had made a public repo and pasted the correct link\nWarm regards,\nSiddhant"

A wrong answer can\u2019t be marked as correct after evaluation as @carlton sir said, simply because we don\u2019t have the correct dataset to perform operation so how do we assess the correctness after evaluation? The correct answer might be wrong if it is NaN but a wrong answer is definitely wrong. Mathematically correlation function is defined in two arrays of numbers, if we don\u2019t have them (due to incorrect data) answer should be undefined not between [-1,1]"

Will their \u201cincorrect answer\u201d still be accepted?\nPlease give a detailed reply so I can mark it as solution, @carlton sir\nThank you"

    "content": "Thanks @carlton, here is my thought process on the same,\nIn the context of year this is a subjective interpretation, so when we say users joined after 2020 it can also mean users joined after (year) 2020 \u201chas set in\u201d.  This is used frequently in English for time units which has the potential to continue for some time like season, quarter, month etc.\nJust to give you an example, a simple google search of \u201cIndian cricketers born after 1988\u201d includes cricketers who are born in 1988. Now I understand Google is not the truth provenance for this, but this is just to illustrate that this interpretation also exists.\n{3D684798-96C5-4D1F-B785-345E9A6C1AA0}1661\u00d7755 131 KB\nSo in the context of this question, I would not say the script is totally wrong, but at the same time the OP of this topic is also not wrong in his interpretation. And thus I asked for your opinion\\clarification on the question that does it mean users joined Github starting 2020 or starting 2021? because I would not want to risk my 1 mark because of ambiguity of English language and would rather go with the intent of the question that people of the other side of the desk have set it with.\nI hope that clarifies what I wanted to ask. In my honest opinion, there is no black and white answer to this topic, so I would go with the logic the script is implemented with, believing that it was the original intent of the question.\nRegards,\nBhavin"

If you submitted early the full assignment we will still consider it for grading (aka\u2026\n  \n\nAlso Project is separate from Assignments.

Which programming language is the second most popular among users who joined after 2020?\nIt is asking for second most popular language, but it\u2019s accepting the first popular language.\nI am getting following as output for languages with their count (popularity) for users who joined after 2020:\nlanguage\nPython              10\nNaN                  9\nHTML                 6\nTypeScript           5\nC++                  3\nJavaScript           3\nJupyter Notebook     3\nAstro                2\nVue                  2\nC#                   2\nName: count, dtype: int64\n\nIt should accept HTML, but it\u2019s accepting Python.\nimage739\u00d7182 13.4 KB\n\nQ12. Do hireable users follow more people than those who are not hireable?\nFor Q12 as well as Q15, it\u2019s not accepting the numeric value, marking it as incorrect (I\u2019ve tried several ways, got same value again and again), it is marking NaN as correct.\nimage739\u00d7182 21.3 KB\nimage739\u00d7182 20.2 KB\nRegarding these 2 questions, there might be some issue in my users.csv, but I am not sure of, because I am getting number as a result while executing Python code. Please clarify this.\n\nPlease clarify these issues sir.\n\nAlso, If any other student has got same Quiz ID: Beijing:500, please confirm whether this is happening to you as well, or it\u2019s an issue from my end (csv file data ambiguity).\n\nThank you,\nParampreet Singh"

    "content": "Hi Nomaan,\nPeers will focus on the 3 bullet points.\n\nAn explanation of how you scraped the data\nThe most interesting and surprising fact you found after analyzing the the data\nAn actionable recommendation for developers based on your analysis\n\nEverything you provide as support for the 3 bullet points is upto the peers whether to consider in their evaluation. The bullet points will be in the README.md\nThe process is about how you scraped, how you obtained the result and how did you formulate the recommendation. (So in effect it involves all 3 bullet points)\nThe results are a combination of the facts and your recommendation. Sometimes a fact might lead to an erroneous recommendation due to mistakes in process. So results cannot be considered in isolation of point 2 or point 3. Its an amalgam of the two (at least that is my understanding).\nIn other words there is not a clear distinction. The three bullet points will be evaluated wholistically to answer the questions of ranking PROCESS and RESULTS.\nHope that helped.\nNice that you are thinking about this carefully   Most people just do the analytical part and forget the most important bit: communicating something useful.\nKind regards,"

Here is a picture for reference.\nWhatsApp Image 2024-10-22 at 17.31.09_abe600461000\u00d7633 74.5 KB\nwhat I have done with the questions is as follows:\n11. binary encoded the columns has_projects and has_wiki then computed then correlation coefficient.\n12. as given in the question, computed the average following for rows with hireable=true and subtracting from it, the average following of rest of the rows (ie. other than TRUE)\n13. in this question, I have computed the regression slope of followers on bio_word count. I have also tried the correlation of length of their bio in unicode characters and followers. none are working.\n15. again, like the question said, for hireable=TRUE i\u2019m obtaining the fraction of users with email an then from it, subtracting fraction of users with email where hireable is not TRUE.\nthese were mostly done on excel. Could you please help me in understanding my faults? also please confirm if my understanding of the questions is correct.\nwould be thankful for any kind of help."

If you find that there is more than one surname with an equal number of count(i.e. tie), provide them all, separating each by a comma. For e.g. if you have 2 most popular surnames, you can provide - surname1,surname2. You do not have to provide the count (mentioned as \u2018x\u2019 in your example above)\nQuoting Question 16 - \u201c\u2026 What\u2019s the most common surname?

Which also means there can be no NaNs in those columns. Everything must be either true or false.\nOnce the csv files are corrected the repo needs to be updated in the submission.\nQ13 is regression of followers on word count. Make sure the correct columns are assigned for x and y values. Because you will get very different results depending on what you choose as the dependent value and the independent value.\nKind regards"

There could be something incorrect in the way you\u2019ve formed your query string.\n(b) If the above is not the reason and you believe you formed the query string right, print the query string in your program and paste that on the browser and see if you can debug more.\n(c) You may have to enable specific fine grained access to the github token. But this does not appear to be the reason since you mentioned the token for module 5 (which is not the same as the github personal acces token which you need to generate yourself from your github account )"

I have reviewed my calculations extensively and believe my answers should be correct, yet they are not accepted.\nI have been attempting to resolve this issue for the past two days, and it has been a source of considerable stress, especially as this project accounts for 20% of my total score. I am attaching the code I used for these questions. I have also sought assistance from some senior students, who reviewed and tested the code but encountered the same issues, with answers still being marked as incorrect.\nquestion 12\nScreenshot 2024-10-30 1011071430\u00d7991 59 KB\nquestion 15\nScreenshot 2024-10-30 1013131433\u00d7968 52.3 KB\nplease help me out with this as it is very important part of the course."

What\u2019s the correlation of the length of their bio (in Unicode words, split by whitespace) with followers? (Ignore people without bios)\nRegression slope of followers on bio word count (to 3 decimal places, e.g. 12.345 or -12.345)\nI am not getting exact answer for it. Is it enough to check non empty bio and corresponding followers or any other condition. What to find correlation, or regression or anything else. Please clarify it.\nI am getting correct results for all the other Qs. So what is the mistake I did."

    "content": "Thank you Carlton for raising the query for extension w/operations.\nJust so it serves as a future reference, I think it is pertinent for ops to maintain consistency in policies. Here are the relevant points:\nPoint#1\nI believe operations drafted the student\u2019s handbook and it very unambiguosly states  for assignment submission dates:\nDate has been changed keeping in mind quiz on Oct 27 and Diwali on Oct 31\nThe above statement shows clear flexibilty (the way it should be) that allows some breathing space keeping in mind quiz 1, travel and a prominent festival date (all sandwitched between the T and T+10 dates). This project is an assignment so why isn\u2019t that policy relevant in the context of TDS P1? That\u2019s the first question.\nPoint# 2\nLike I mentioned before, why is a major project submission date coinciding with a prominent festival? It should not be a mechanical \u201cSince P1 was published on T=21st Oct, lets just add T+10 to it and derive submission date as 31st Oct\u201d. Well, 31st Oct happens to be Diwali - why wasn\u2019t that considered.?\n\u201cProviding ample time\u201d argument, I feel, is besides the point. I started P1 post Quiz 1 and have personally finished the scraper and the calculations in under 5 hours total multi tasking with other stuff (for no other reason but for the fact that I\u2019ve some prior experience). Rather, what I question is purely from the standpoint of point#1 and point#2 (e.g. adherence to stated policy standpoint) rather than whether the task is doable.\nI feel planning should have more nuance to it than merely adding a constant and deriving at an end date. A couple of days extra is all there was to it. Wouldn\u2019t you agree?\nBest regards,\nBahni"

Pls check if the booleans have been correctly saved in the csvs (both users and repositories csv). Verify there are no uppercase True or False booleans anywhere in the two files.\n(b) Assuming booleans are correctly saved in both the csvs, double check if the two csvs are (a) committed and (b) in the main branch. But, that should be the case anyways, because the errors you see are only for specific questions.\n(c) If you\u2019ve updated the csv files in main, do a hard browser refresh.

When you reach questions 11, 12, 13, and 15, you start wondering where things are going wrong. After reviewing all the hints, I realized that the code checking your answer treats \u201ctrue\u201d and \u201cfalse\u201d as strings. If you check the file uploaded on GitHub and look at the raw version, you\u2019ll see that it has everything stored as either TRUE/FALSE or True/False. Opening the file on your machine doesn\u2019t help, because Excel automatically interprets these values as booleans.\nHere\u2019s what I did\u2014not the best method, and I\u2019m sure someone could code a solution, but I did the best I could. I copied the raw file content from GitHub and pasted it into a Word document. I replaced all instances of FALSE with false and TRUE with true, then copied that back into the GitHub raw file and committed the changes.\nOnce done, return to the project page and enter the same answers you initially got through your code or manual calculations, and you\u2019ll see things align. I know this isn\u2019t the most elegant solution, and I should handle it programmatically, but sometimes you have to implement fixes that work rather than seeking the most elegant solution. Hope this helps!"

But I would argue that in case you\u2019re unable to code the quickest retrieval that is possible, you can continue with your current approach (with Github\u2019s personal access token) and have the full user and repositories csvs to complete the project questions."

    "content": "Thank you Carlton. Couple of follow up questions though.\n\nRight above the timelines in the course dashboard, it mentions the Sep 2024 grading document as the document containing the latest official information. Do the timelines specified on the course dashboard (screenshot above) overrides all timelines mentioned in the Sep 2024 grading documentation for TDS? If that is the case, I would suggest that the grading document be synced up with these updates so the information stays consistent at all locations.\nThe submission timeline for Project 1 (P1) has been specified as Nov 10, 2024 in the grading document, however, on the course dashboard the project submission date is mentioned as 28th Oct, 2024 (a mismatch of close to 2 weeks). Which one is the correct submission date for P1?\nIn case it is 28th Oct, 2024 (as mentioned in the course dashboard), it will be a rather demanding timeline (specifically for students who have in center Quiz 1 for 3 subjects on 27th Oct) and the project submission date happens to be the very next day.  Add to that the fact that some candidates need to travel (intra-city) to and from the test centre.\nPlease review and advise on the dates mismatch (for all projects and exams for TDS).\nThanks.\n"

    "content": "Thank you Carlton. I refered to the grading document and see that the grading document is in sync now.\nCan the course admin team take a look at point # 2 I mentioned above and respond? I noticed that the projects 1 and 2 have a timeframe of 10 days per project. Project # 1 has a release date of today (it has not been released until noon, I presume the project will be released later in the day). So, I am not sure what is the complexity level of project # 1. However, I raised the point of Quiz 1 because:\n(a) There will be students who will be appearing in as many as 3 subjects in Quiz 1 (in the case they have TDS as their 4th subject), and\n(b) There will be students who will be travelling intra city to appear for Quiz 1 (so in order to accomodate candidates who fall in this category, at the least, 26th, 27th and 28th Oct. should not even be considered as days which will be available to them to work on the project).\nWith that said, can the course admin team review the submission date for project 1 and provide flexibility considering overlap of Quiz 1 (e.g. preparations, mock tests (mock tests are typically solved by many in the week prior to the quiz) and the logistics involved on the part of the candidate, for example, intra-city travel (for many))?"

    "content": "Just a bit of feedback to the course admin team because I do see there is a need for better planning around the timelines and offering flexibility when there are genuine reasons to do so. Consider these points:\n\nI mentioned in point (b) above that if the plan is to provide 10 days to work on projects 1 and 2 (publish till submission) that has a weightage of 20% overall, then I raised a pertinent point that 26th, 27th and 28th October should be excluded from the planning because there are students who travel inter city and we do spend a greater part of the two days pre and prior to the quiz date traveling to and from the test city. I did not receive any response on why that rationale (e.g. the case of students who travel inter city for the offline exams) should not be factored into in your planning. So effectively,  for some,  the days available for project 1 reduces to 7-8 (give or take).\nWeek 4 GA assignment end date was scheduled just 1.5 days prior to Quiz 1 (and there are students who take up as many as 4 subjects per term and have to work on mock tests before appearing for the offline Quizzes)\nThe submission date for Project 1 coincides with the date of a prominent national festival!\nIf I may quote from the student\u2019s handbook, there is a clear policy of offering flexibility around such key events (excerpt below):\n*Date has been changed keeping in mind quiz on Oct 27 and Diwali on Oct 31\nIf weekly assignment submission date (which in most cases have a weightage of just 1%) can be adjusted keeping in mind key events, then a project that carries a weightage of 20% overall should have offered a few day\u2019s additional flexibility in line with the stated policies in the Student\u2019s handbook.\n"

What\u2019s the correlation of the length of their bio (in Unicode words, split by whitespace) with followers? (Ignore people without bios)\nRegression slope of followers on bio word count (to 3 decimal places, e.g. 12.345 or -12.345)\nI am not getting exact answer for it. Is it enough to check non empty bio and corresponding followers or any other condition. What to find correlation, or regression or anything else.

So pls do analyse your data to see if it warrants any detailed maneuvering\n\nFor the purpose of assignment, I will only remove the leading @ , and validate my Q4 answer by clicking \u201cCheck answers\u201d button\nAs an exercise in learning, you may parse all @companies and identify the top one [ BTW, Q16 explores that with a slightly different ask]\n\nDo you think this is a good candidate for your Readme.md?

It was meant to be 25/10/2024 23:59 Hrs, however it was unintentionally closed at 5.29am. \nPlease rest assured, there are at least three alternative proposals being considered to mitigate this mistake on our part. Our goal is to make the restitution as painless as possible but also fair to those that submitted their assignments early. If you submitted early the full assignment we will still consider it for grading (aka\u2026\n  \n\nKind regards"

It was meant to be 25/10/2024 23:59 Hrs, however it was unintentionally closed at 5.29am. \nPlease rest assured, there are at least three alternative proposals being considered to mitigate this mistake on our part. Our goal is to make the restitution as painless as possible but also fair to those that submitted their assignments early. If you submitted early the full assignment we will still consider it for grading (aka\u2026\n  \n\nKind regards"

It was returning a 429 status code.\nI was sure the no of users in Mumbai are not that low, so after some investigation and asking chatgpt about it I understand there is a rate limit set by github to avoid overburdening their servers.\nOne solution to this is creating a personal access token which increases your rate limit from ~60 to ~5000 per hour. But i have checked and there are around ~55,000 users (in Mumbai).\nAre we supposed to fetch 5000 records  per hour for 11 hours; which does not seem like the way to go, or is there some other way to handle this rate limit.\nPlease advice."

Error: Expected ~602 users in Bangalore with 100+ followers, got 32\u201d.\nI have tried using Github python library as well as invoking the API using Requests library but I am getting the same result of 32 users.\nI then tried with Postman to validate the query params individually, but I got the same result. The GET request I tried is as below,\n\u201chttps://api.github.com/search/users?q=location%3ABanglore%20followers%3A>100&per_page=100\u201d\nCould there be an issue with the validation? or do I need to get all the Banglore users (around 9K) and then invoke their individual followers URL to find out their individual count, which IMO will be an overkill."

The  issue is resolved.\nWhat happened?\nMy code checks if the repository has valid values, and if not, sets the expected answers to random numbers to prevent guessing.\nBut (a) if we don\u2019t submit a repo, it never gets to the second part, and (b) I didn\u2019t test this scenario.\nSo, thanks for flagging this early!\nThere were 8 students who submitted partial results so far:\n22f3002743@ds.study.iitm.ac.in\n21f2000168@ds.study.iitm.ac.in\n23f1003155@ds.study.iitm.ac.in\n23ds3000248@ds.study.iitm.ac.in\n22f3001210@ds.study.iitm.ac.in\n22f1001615@ds.study.iitm.ac.in\n22f3002293@ds.study.iitm.ac.in\n21f2001119@ds.study.iitm.ac.in\nI\u2019ve deleted these entries (and mailed them).

The thread being referred to indicates that you would have to reply to that discourse post itself in order for the submission to be considered valid. However, the email clearly states donot_reply. So its a bit strange to reply to a donot_reply email address?\nI have informed @s.anand as he has discretion on the marking.\nKind regards"

    "content": "Hi Kumar,\nThis is the TDS channel and the current playlist.\nCurrently it has only the first TA session released 9 days ago.\n \n\nUnfortunately we have only a partial recording of the previous TA session (last Sunday, 6th oct). It largely covered some of the GA0 material and some general topics.\nTomorrow\u2019s session (13th Oct) will be more substantial as it will get into the material that will almost certainly be tested in the ROE.\nIf we feel there is value in the partial recording then we will release it, but for the moment, i think most of it will get subsumed into what will be explained by tomorrows session.\nWe also usually add more sessions as it warrants if we percieve that more time is needed to cover some of the topics.\nWeek 1 has been largely self explanatory with regards to getting familiar with the tools. There was a small section in the previous recording that i might still release, which showcased how to get started with vscode, setting up a virtual environment and some useful extensions. (But if you are already familiar with that and had no trouble with week 0 then the recording is of little value to you).\nKind regards"

    "content": "A good point. I have thought about it.\nThe web design best practice is to open links in the same tab because:\n\nUsers can control it:  Users can right-click and \u201cOpen link in new tab\u201d. But if the link is set to open in a new tab, there\u2019s no way around that. Also, users expect clicking to continue in the same window by default.\nBrowser Behavior and Navigation: Most modern browsers preserve the page scroll location when you press the back button. Also, new windows can disrupt the flow of the back button and make navigation less intuitive.\nAccessibility: Screen readers don\u2019t do so well with new windows. It may not be immediately apparent that a new window has opened, leading to confusion.\n\nA good workaround for these is TamperMonkey. You can write your own scripts that automatically load video links from TDS in a new window."

Have you followed the instructions carefully or looked at the sample notebook which was provided in the Week 4 content that accesses the same repository to see how one might access the database?\nimport pandas as pd\nimport sqlalchemy as sa\n\nengine = sa.create_engine(\"mysql+pymysql://guest:relational@db.relational-data.org/stats\")\n\nNote: This code snippet was taken from the same sample notebook provided in Week 4. It will not work if you copy paste it. You have to change it to suit what your question is asking.\nIMPORTANT: When debugging your code make sure you are not hitting the public endpoint again and again. That\u2019s a sure fire way to get banned from accessing it.\nConnect ONCE using the right connection details. Get the required data ONCE and store it either in a variable (or on disk - which is preferred because then even if your code crashes you can retrieve the data locally). Then do the debugging of the rest of your code ad nauseum. Jupyter Notebooks are very useful in this regard for separating out code cells and doing the debugging separately from your data connection/fetch cells.\nRegards"

So it would happen even inside a python library that used the same algorithm but it would not be immediately evident and easily go unnoticed unless you were diligent about coding in some checks.\nWhereas the advantage with a tool like open refine you can immediately spot the problem very quickly before it happens."

    "content": "Dear Anju,\nI have checked both questions, and I am getting the answer that is within the provided range.\nGA3 is challenging. If I may be completely candid, it looks like an answer spat out by GPT. For example there is a meaningless operation\nmatch = pattern.match (line)\nWhy? what\u2019s wrong with just line? (assuming logs are an array of lines)\nDid you try to examine the output of a few samples of each match to see if you are actually getting the expected output at each stage of the regex?\nIt might be that your regex is not performing as expected and filtering out the wrong lines. Regex is a tough and unforgiving tool to debug.\nI will show how to solve this in the live TA session, and I will show a much simpler method that is humanly easily verifiable.\nFrom the movie Maverick Topgun\u2026\nThe end is inevitable, Maverick. Your kind is headed for extinction.\njjaevdoscwpb12034\u00d71203 322 KB\nSomeday GPT will relegate such skills obsolete\u2026 But until that day\u2026\nYours truly,\nTDS TA\nPS: Moral of the story is its okay to use GPT. In fact we encourage it (it is the future), but please try to do some basic debugging and checks first. Use GPT in a progressive step wise fashion so that you can verifiably solve the problem. I am here to guide you on your TDS journey. I will not be able to debug GPT\u2019s code all the time because, lets face it. GPT knows a lot more than me. It just does not have \u201cbrains\u201d. So sometimes you need to think about what is actually happening instead of completely treating it as a magic black box. Cheers!"

    "content": "Hi Tarun,\nCould you share the question, as it is parameterised for all students. Also typically if you are getting several questions wrong, then its far more likely that the logic you have employed has errors.\nI have looked at your code and presumed that it is /hindimp3/ and Tuesday. I do get the correct answer in the range you provided.\nAlso if you wanted help with code, it is not practical to debug your code when you share screen shots. It is far more kinder (indeed almost a prerequisite for code that is more than a couple of lines) to those who might help you to actually encapsulate your code in block quotes.\nA good example of how to ask help, is like how this fellow student has demonstrated:\n\n\n\n\nDoubt GA-1 Tools in Data Science\n\n\n    Quiz id: e23cf3e74cea4b56a217372fafc75228 \nIn Q-3, Every time I am getting different when I hit the link for collab notebook to fix the code and get back to the page light_pixels = np.sum(lightness > 0.246)  this value '0.246' is changing every time that means window is reloading every time so I am sure answers of my last two question would be change also then what to do in that case \nimport numpy as np\nfrom PIL import Image\nfrom google.colab import files\nimport colorsys\n\n# There is a mistake in\u2026\n  \n\nYou are likely to get much more help if you do so.\nRegards"

So, there\u2019re 30 rows in each group, and, I am supposed to work on group 5 to 50(both inclusive), that is, from row index 120 to 1499. I converted the pdf to a csv file, opened it using pandas, got the row index from 120 to 1499(I did cross check this being correct), and, then, I stored those rows where marks in Physics is greater than 63, and, then, used the .sum() on the new table. On doing this, I am getting a value which is something 29806(something around this).\nHere, I am attatching my code.\nimage1920\u00d71080 226 KB"

A common mistake is assuming that the conversion from pdf to csv is without any anomalies.\nThere is an error in the conditions you used. It does not match what was asked in the question.\nAlso what is in row 1499?

Business or gaming. Anything is fine. Your choice.\nCreate the app only using LLMs. You can use an LLM (ChatGPT, Claude.ai, Gemini, Cursor, Cody, etc.) but you can only prompt the app to write code. You can copy-paste code and run code don\u2019t write or edit even a single line of code directly. Use LLMs to debug and edit. Code completion is NOT allowed \u2013 only prompting/chatting.\nRecord the entire process in 10 min. Don\u2019t edit, trim, enhance, or annotate the video. You should record yourself creating the entire app from start to finish. Practice beforehand if you like. Record in 1 take.\nShare the video and app. Publish the video publicly anywhere (e.g. YouTube and share the link.) Publish the app publicly anywhere (e.g. GitHub pages, Glitch.me, Heroku, etc.) or upload a ZIP file with the code (for slightly lower marks.)\n\nSubmit via a reply to this thread. Multiple submissions per person are fine. Work in groups if you like but only the submitter gets marks.\nI will award up to 1 bonus mark at my discretion based on:\n\nHow well you prompt the LLM\nHow impressive the app is (if you\u2019ve hosted it - I probably won\u2019t run your code)\nHow closely you followed the rules above\n\nThis exercise is to help you (and me) learn a topic that\u2019ll probably change the way we all code: using LLMs to code.\nCutoff date: 7 Oct 2024, AoE"

Chrome correctly downloads the .txt file while some other browsers seem to not download it correctly.\nThis issue was noticed by @rajyalakshmi on this post\n\n\n\nGA1 Q2 - Clarification needed Tools in Data Science\n\n\n    A strange observation is that when I download from Chrome, it gets downloaded as expected. But from Firefox, the new lines are missing. \nI will troubleshoot if any settings/plug-ins are causing this. \nThanks for your support.\n  \n\nKind Regards"

    "content": "@22f3001318 \u2013 yes, that can happen.\nThis is a good opportunity to talk about two-way doors. Jeff Bezos wrote:\n\nSome decisions are consequential and irreversible or nearly irreversible \u2013 one-way doors \u2013 and these decisions must be made methodically, carefully, slowly, with great deliberation and consultation. If you walk through and don\u2019t like what you see on the other side, you can\u2019t get back to where you were before. We can call these Type 1 decisions. But most decisions aren\u2019t like that \u2013 they are changeable, reversible \u2013 they\u2019re two-way doors. If you\u2019ve made a suboptimal Type 2 decision, you don\u2019t have to live with the consequences for that long. You can reopen the door and go back through. Type 2 decisions can and should be made quickly by high judgment individuals or small groups\nAs organizations get larger, there seems to be a tendency to use the heavy-weight Type 1 decision-making process on most decisions, including many Type 2 decisions. The end result of this is slowness, unthoughtful risk aversion, failure to experiment sufficiently, and consequently diminished invention. We\u2019ll have to figure out how to fight that tendency\n\nGA1 is a good example of a 2-way door. Try an approach. If the answer is incorrect, try another. You get instant feedback. No need to check.\nHere\u2019s what I suggest. Go ahead and let the newer file replace the older one. If the answer\u2019s incorrect, try it the other way around. One or the other will work if you have the rest of the steps right.\nBut to your question, yes, duplicate files CAN occur."

    "content": "Windows files system is case insensitive. Linux typically uses a case sensitive filesystem (although you can configure it to whatever you wanted).\nTypically a VM is completely isolated, however because WSL still has to be accessible to the windows filesystem (you can for example view the WSL filesystem directly from windows file explorer), it seems to have been configured with a case insensitive filesystem. This is odd in your case because Windows documentation seems to suggest the default is otherwise. Case Sensitivity | Microsoft Learn\nGoogle Colab notebooks has a linux backend and currently runs on Ubuntu 22.04\nYou can run these in your google colab to see what it runs\n\n!cat /etc/*release\n\nThis is the file system info\n\n!df -Th\n\nIncredibly on ext4 (which typically what most default linux systems use), you are even able to enable case insensitivity on a directory by directory basis! (for those power users that have very specific use cases). Windows also claims to now support this feature on NT through the use of directory flags.\nNice bit of work.\nKind regards"

I am moderately comfortable with Python (although I haven\u2019t done it, I\u2019m fairly confident I can get at least a B in PDSA if I do it now; using specific libraries is an entirely different question). Regarding Excel, most things used in BDM should be fine for me. Now comes the HTML and JavaScript part. I can read and understand some pure HTML code and make static pages without any bells and whistles\u2014which more or less amounts to nothing, as it will just look like an average LaTeX document. I know nothing about Java or JavaScript. Now, dropping the course is not really a good option for me due to some personal reasons. Hence, I\u2019m thinking of just learning what\u2019s needed on the go. I am sure there will be others in a similar situation too.\nThings being what they are (I didn\u2019t know about these prerequisites early enough, so I didn\u2019t prepare during the three-week gap after the last term exams), can you please suggest some references\u2014documents, books, articles, sites, or YouTube playlists\u2014for getting started in the best possible way? It would have been nice if such content were curated and added as Week 0\u2014MLF has a Week 0 where they list out some topics from statistics and mathematics.\nIt would be helpful if the resources are divided into categories like:\n\nMinimal to get going, and can learn more as needed\nAll that we need\n\nIf it can also be structured like these concepts would be used in week n; knowing this concept will provide better insights, it would be great.\nTL;DR\nPlease provide some structured resources for the prerequisites, such as articles, documents, books, or YouTube playlists.\nThanks for any help and your time.

    "content": "Hi Hari,\nPlease refer to the course introduction page. Most students ignore this page, but for TDS it is a source of very valuable information.\n\nYou should be comfortable coding in Python, HTML, JavaScript, Excel, and have a basic understanding of data science concepts.\n\nGA0 is meant to point you to the problem (skill requirements). We will provide some more specific resources as the course progresses, but for the above, any google search will provide you good beginner resources to get started. One of the key skills of Data Science is given a problem, finding the data.\nHow you solve that problem is part of your growth. Since these are very basic requirements, we do not typically give recommendations as everyone has a different learning style. You have to find resources that suit your style.\nFor the more in depth topics we will cover them in the live sessions, lectures and the resource links we will provide that go with those topics.\nPlease feel free to contribute what you have discovered to be great resources (as new ones keep popping up and they are quite good, so it will be good for all of us including the TDS team, to see what students find). Last term for example @eram1011 did a phenomenal job of collating information of the various resources for TDS.\n\n\n\n\nTDS May 2024 Portal Resource Links Tools in Data Science\n\n\n    Here is the collection of all the links provided on the portal up to the current week for the May 2024 term for learning TDS. I felt the need to save all of them for my learning checklist and future reference. I\u2019m sharing this in the hope that it might save you some time if you also need the links in one place. I plan to update this post regularly with week-wise content. \n\nWEEK1 Data discovery \n\n\nhttps://datasetsearch.research.google.com/\nhttps://data.gov/\nhttps://data.gov.ru/?language=en \n\n\u2026\n  \n\nPlease note that each term TDS changes. So not everything from last term will be the same. So not everything on that discourse post will be used. It is a good starting point.\nKind regards"

For those that want fat free info:\nTDS is practical.\nREAD the Course Introduction LOTs of invaluable Information.\nStart preparing for ROE NOW.\nEnd term is theory based and is much easier than GAs, Projects, ROE.\nProject Score  = 80% based on answers to project questions  + 20% are from Peer Reviews.\nProject comprises of Quantitative and Qualitative. Peer reviews are on the qualitative part. Reviews that are outliers are rejected.\nBonus Marks are only on Discourse. Answers must be submitted according to the Discourse post. Discretion of Bonus Marks are upto how impressed the Prof is with your submission.\nBonus Marks are really worth it. In total they are worth half of the total GAs.\nAlso Bonus Marks are great fun!\nROE Mocks are just previous ROEs.\nThere is no pattern for ROEs. They are never the same as previous ROEs.\nHowever core skills of ROEs remain the same:\n\nScraping webpages. HTML, CSS, Javascript (particularly for selecting dom elements), sessions, cookies.\nScrapping PDFs. Python Tabula library.\nPython (especially Pandas)\nNominatim\nSQL\nand maybe some other minor tools.\n\nROE week content: Week 2 to 4\nROE is open book (not proctored, use anything you wish including GPT)\nROE is very, very hard. Start preparing now.\nSCT is NOT required for ROE.\nWeek 5: you will get some $ allowance for LLM tokens. Awesome. And super fun topic.\nOptional Videos in week 2 are NOT optional. They are a necessary for ROE (and end term).\nBonus 1: Making LLM app: Just sharing the code on Github is not an app. Github and Github Pages are NOT the same thing. Github Pages is a web server where you can deploy your app. Github repo is just a place to store and share your code. An app is a working application that anyone with web access can use just by clicking on the link you provide.\nYour app has to be submitted in the Discourse post where the Bonus post was made.\nSubscribe to Discourse emails for TDS. That way you will not miss important information like the Bonus questions.\nListen to Podcast - very informational about current data science industry.\nBASH - there is a great book for this from System Commands.\n\n\naccounts.google.com\n\n\nGoogle Drive: Sign-in\nAccess Google Drive with a Google account (for personal use) or Google Workspace account (for business use).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe links at the bottom and top of videos in the modules are very valuable.\nWeek 1 Video session is available on the TDS You Tube Video Playlist.\n\n\nAccess will NOT be given to the video links in the calendar. The ONLY place to get access to the videos will be the TDS You Tube Video Channel.\nKind regards,\nTDS TA"

Therefore even if you submit, and come back to it, it will get refreshed.\nIf you have programmatically solved the question (as is the intent most of the time, because its faster, scalable, repeatable), then resolving a new set should be trivial. If you do a lot of manual solving, then yes it will be very tedious and you have not gained the learning that is expected.\nBottom line: Do the GA1 in one go.\nThis feature is being tested only for the GA1 (and GA0). The remaining GAs will be normal like you are used to in the seek portal.\nFor next term the goal is to roll this out for most if not all the GAs (in TDS at least) by learning what to improve and what achieves the best learning outcome.\nRegards"

Just a suggestion, if I may: A nudge on where the mistake is may be useful. For example, Have you correctly copied the question command? or have you checked the last update date of the file? The reason behind this suggestion is my experience with one of the questions where till the end I could not figure what was wrong. After sir mentioned the locale sort and it was rectified later for all, I realized what was going wrong. I spent nearly an hour on it trying to check everything but finally gave up. Again, there is a learning in frustration but sometimes, people (like me) will give up after getting 9/10 and not do the whole thing again just for a 10/10."

Is small d before capital G?\nIt depends on how the UNIX sort command operates. If the locale (e.g. via the environment variable LC_ALL) is set to C, it sorts like programmers expect \u2014 uppercase before lowercase.\nIf it\u2019s set to something else, e.g. en_GB.UTF, it would sort like the British do.\nI missed anticipating that others\u2019 systems would have different locale settings. Now, I\u2019ve changed the question now to explicitly set LC_ALL=C to get consistent sorting.\nThanks for flagging this!"

It is listed as a pre-requisite in the course introduction section. I find it frustrating that these aren\u2019t taught in any courses of the diploma program and neither does the general description of the course (here: Course Page - IIT Madras Diploma Program) state knowing javascript and html is a pre-requsite. It simply says Machine Learning Foundations is a co-requisite. I have cleared Math-2, Stat-2, MLF and BDM.\nDo I need to rethink taking up this course? Do I first need to learn javascript and html from elsewhere and then take this course? Please clarify.\nThank you."

    "content": "Hi Viraj,\nThe reason for GA0 is simple. It gives you a flavour of what you need to be comfortable with in order to be able to do well in the course. Generally if you are struggling with these basics (because that is what they are), then you will have to put extra effort in order to get up to speed. TDS covers a lot of ground in terms of the tools used for Data Science. Past experience shows us that students who are not comfortable with the basics find the Remote Online Exam very challenging and many score 0.\nSo the GA0 gives you a chance to assess if you want to \u201cbite the bullet\u201d and take the course or do you want to give yourself some time to become familiar with the basic requirements. We do this early so that you can still avail the drop window, if you find the the course challenging.\nWe (the TDS team) have lobbied hard to actually have some concrete (programming) pre-requisites for this course, but the BS management (not the TDS team) has countered with, this is not possible because some students only do the Data Science Diploma. I totally agree that these requirements must be made known prior to taking this course. However due to an impasse on how to structure the diploma, to better deal with this issue, it is what it is. I know this is not of much comfort. Having said that, you also have one of the best professors and I dare say with the backing of data (some of the best TAs) in the program who are here to help you succeed. But it will require much effort compared to most other subjects.\nStudents who have been through TDS can mostly vouch for one thing. Its one of the most interesting, practical and useful course in making you job ready. But it is a trial by fire. However if you have done the diploma in programming, its fairly easy (which is why we always recommend taking it towards the end of the diploma).\nHope that helps.\nKind regards"

    "content": "Dear Sirs @s.anand and @carlton ,\nI went through a few videos of the course available on youtube via acegrade and I am able to understand things with the help of web search and AI. But it all feels haphazard since I have no familiarity with the html/js. Even the python libraries being used are unfamiliar. I MAY pull through the course but it is my feeling that it will be far from satisfactory for me since I like to learn things in a structured manner.\nYou have said doing diploma in programming will help understand this course much better. I cannot do the entire diploma, but can you suggest some courses from the programming diploma which I may look through in this term and take this course up in the next term? And/or, can you suggest any other source from where I can learn given my background and requirements of this course?\nI am thankful your response."

Please keep everything in a single post per student (i.e do not make multiple post submissions)\n\nPlease use the poll below to indicate your issue and provide a detailed response as a reply to this post.\n\n\n\nI was unable to click on \u201cSubmit\u201d button, but I was able to click on \u201cTest Run\u201d\nI was neither able to click on \u201cSubmit\u201d nor \u201cTest Run\u201d\nI had a different issue\n\n\n\n\n\n0\nvoters\n\n\n\n\nRegarding submission issues related to Peer Reviews for Project 1\nClarification\n \nPeer Review submission = You submit for review from others + You review submission given by others \n\nAnd there is a causal link between these two, i.e., you submit for getting review from others and hence you receive and hence you get an opportunity to review others. It should not be treated as mutually independent events\nThe opportunity being provided now is for those who faced technical issues in either of the parts and due to which they were unable to submit.\n\nOn Friday, August 9, 2024 6:30 AM, we will open the peer review submissions for Project 1 and this will be open till Saturday, August 10, 2024 6:30 AM. The reviews will have to be subsequently completed by Sunday, August 11, 2024 6:30 AM. This will be your last window to submit your part 2 submission and its peer reviews. If you encounter any problems on the day, please get straight away in touch with us through this discourse thread, so that the operations team can in real time evaluate the problem that you are encountering and get you a resolution.\nIf you are unable to access the review submissions due to insufficient access privileges, give a zero for that review and move on to the next review.\nLikewise please ensure that your project folder has been given full access permissions to \u201cAnyone with the link\u201d. Otherwise you will get a 0 from other reviewers.\nIf you have concerns about getting bad reviews, please read the Course introduction page, a clear detailed explanation is given with regards to how we handle anomalous reviews. So do not worry about it. Please do not fill up discourse with complaints about peer reviews. We have a mechanism to deal with it fairly. If on the other hand you have received 100% when you should not have\u2026 be ready to be evaluated fairly too. It cuts both ways.\nAlso, please note that we will be considering the marks for only those who had submission issues for the part 2 assignments earlier. In case you have already received your reviews, we will not be considering your review score for this assignment. In case you missed out on reviewing others in the earlier submission, reviewing as part of current submission will not fetch you marks.\n\nEdit: Updated the nature of submission to include both Part 2 submission and its peer review and detailed out the cases that will be considered for final mark calculation."

    "content": "Network analysis is used in climate modeling to study complex interactions and relationships within the climate system. It allows researchers to understand how different components of the climate system (e.g., temperature, precipitation, atmospheric circulation) are interconnected. Here are some ways network analysis is applied in climate modeling:\nSpatio-temporal network analysis for studying climate patterns | Climate Dynamics (2014)\nENSO in CMIP5 simulations: network connectivity from the recent past to the twenty-third century | Climate Dynamics (2014)\n\nClimate Networks: Climate data (such as temperature or pressure) from different geographical locations can be represented as a network. In this network, nodes represent locations, and edges represent correlations or interactions between climate variables at these locations. This approach helps in identifying key regions that influence global climate patterns. Networks of climate change: connecting causes and consequences | Applied Network Science | Full Text\nTeleconnections: Network analysis is used to study teleconnections, which are long-distance relationships between climate variables (like the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation or the North Atlantic Oscillation). By analyzing these networks, researchers can detect how changes in one part of the world affect other regions.\nExtreme Event Prediction: Networks help in identifying how extreme weather events, like heat waves or storms, propagate through the system. By mapping these events in a network, it becomes easier to predict areas at risk or potential future events based on past occurrences. Climate network analysis helps pinpoint regions at higher risk of extreme weather | ScienceDaily\nFeedback Loops: Network analysis is useful for identifying feedback loops in the climate system, where changes in one variable influence another, which in turn feeds back into the original variable. For example, melting ice reduces the Earth\u2019s albedo, leading to more warming, which further accelerates ice melt.\n\netc. etc. etc.\nIf you still feel Climate modeling is a \u201cniche\u201d application of network analysis, you can ask the instructors for second consideration.\nKind regards"

But not a bad start! 0.2\n\n\nAs a matter of fact, the app does send the token in the header:\ndef fetch_openai_models(token):\n    url = \"https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/models\"\n    headers = {\n        \"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {token}\",\n        \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\"\n    }\n    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)\n    response.raise_for_status()  # This will raise an exception for HTTP errors\n    return response.json()\n\nCould you please share what is the output you are getting.\nAlso requesting anyone who could please use the app located at TDS Solver using their AI proxy token and share the result. (@iitmanupam tagging you so that I might get a quick feedback, hopefully.)\nThanks in advance and regards\nAnant\nP.S: Sorry, I had to create another thread for it as the original is locked."

For e.g., if you have 10 questions and a total of 16 marks (4 additional for peer reviews), then each correct answer should get you 1.6 marks.\nMultiply the project answer marks by 5 to get your total out of 100. If you want to add peer review marks to it, multiply the marks from the answers by 4 and divide the marks from the peer reviews by 5 and add both of them to get your total marks from Project 1 out of 100."

I hope to be even more beneficial to the data science community in the future.\nMy journey with TDS began with great hope, inspired by its name, \u201cTools in Data Science,\u201d and the practical course outline.\n\nThe first spark I felt was during the live data scraping sessions by Amit Sir, which were incredibly engaging and fun.\n\u201cGramener\u201d and @s.anand Sir have an indescribable aura that instills hope to achieve the depth Anand Sir has reached in the industry.\nThe very humble and supportive CREATIVE trio of Anand Sir, @Amit1 Sir, and @carlton Sir guided us throughout. Whether it was the ROE (which makes me wish for it in place of oppe exams) or the Mission Mars 1-mark optional projects, it was more than I could have asked for when registering for the TDS course.\nOne thing I feel I missed to fully experience the essence of TDS was the weekly Wednesday sessions by Dibu John Sir, as I only watched the recorded sessions on YouTube. When certain modules towards the end of the course had previous term recordings where Dibu Sir interacted with students, I felt I missed something valuable.\n\nAll the course content provided significant value, thanks to the TDS team .\nNot just the official team, but the student community in TDS this term was also a delight, especially the efforts of @Arif in supporting us through the difficulties we faced."

    "content": "Thank you for tagging me.\nMy overall experience was kind of nice. Initially, Week 1 felt very easy but as the weeks progressed, I felt there were so many tools to learn and handle data differently. This is one of the courses where I didn\u2019t make any handwritten notes which I usually have done for all the courses expect English (mostly done with both diplomas).\nThe bonus assignments quite interesting & good for practicing practical skills although I couldn\u2019t do all due to busy schedule and health issues. I did visit discourse from time to time hoping to find more extra activity but later started helping peers & posting my doubts here.\nAs for ROE 1 didn\u2019t feel it that was difficult but had I not have gotten confused with that timing issue (slowed my paced a little thinking it was an hour) I would have done 2 more questions right. It was good though.\nThe projects helped me put my skills to test which ROE didn\u2019t. I used ChatGPT and it worked out so I gave that ROE marks credit to that GPT LLM.\nAt the very last, I was unsure how to prepare for End term but my peers helped me and will post my digital notes (that\u2019s what I prepared a week ago) after  polishing a bit for next term students.\n@s.anand sir\u2019s guidance & teachings helped a lot in building these skills and both the TAs were there to help us @Amit1 @carlton (can\u2019t thank enough).\n@Debasmit used ChatGPT fine-tuned for TDS to generate 300+ questions which were really helpful for end term a big thanks to him.\nEnd term was a breeze completed within 10-15 minutes with hardly 1-2 questions wrong (mistakes checked with answer key - some courses have released that)\nOverall, it was a nice experience with some hiccups like issues in GAs & projects but that\u2019s part & parcel of life (nothing is perfect). I hope I will be able to put these skills to good use in real life.\nWishing the best for everyone here\u2026\nThanks & Regards,\nSwati Jain"

In my eyes, it is the one course that is truly important because it shows me what life would be like in a Data Science role because more than 60% of the time in any such role is spent in data scraping, data cleaning and EDA.\nFor this, I need to thank Professor @s.anand and the TAs @carlton and @Amit1. Without their effort, it would not have been possible for me to roll my sleeves up and get into the thick of it, even if it was at a beginner\u2019s level. I hope I can find some roles in the industry which allow me to explore this area a bit more in a real life project.\nI also feel that given the importance and practical nature of this course, it should be converted to 4 credits with a proper structure and full time instructors to assist the Professor and students."

I was aware of data analysis at high level before but this course delved me into the new realm of data analytics, drawing insights, trends by help of data visualization.\nSpecial thanks to Professor @s.anand and TAs @Amit1, @carlton. Their extensive support and active help on discourse without which this would have been a mess. Exposing to a real world like project rather than restricting to toy example is what makes this subject.\nTalking about ROE, It was hard but again LLM was a savior. It did taught one thing how to tackle a problem under pressure of time.\nEnd term was everyone\u2019s comfort zone I guess. Thanks to the one who made the Chat GPT TDS TA. It crafted the questions well and due to which everyone was able to give end term. Also special thanks to @carlton who conducted a mock for TDS which help to understand difficulty level of questions and gave students a confidence about end term.\nRegards,\nPalash H\nPS. Encourage everyone those who visit this post, feel free to share your experience of TDS."

    "content": "Thank you for tagging me.\nI thoroughly enjoyed each and every piece of the course, right from the beginning. As a person coming from a zero programming background,  I had to endure the various pain points associated with the course (i am talking about myself) specifically in fetching and scrapping data.  I slowly started gaining confidence after watching the videos and TA session recordings multiple times.\nBut that confidence was only short lived as I  was completely  overrun by the ROE juggernaut. I thought ROE is a real out of the box masterclass . It prepares one to handle real world decision making situations in a better way (utilizing limited resources in a optimal manner).\nI would say the course was very well designed and structured capturing all the widely used DS tools. It is also heartening to see the course contents being regularly updated to remain in sync with the rapidly changing  tools and technologies used in data science.\nAt the end of it, it is only postive takeaways for me from this course.  Specifically:\n\nExposure to various tools used in present day DS industry.\nKindling interest to delve deeper in to these tools.\nGiving a birds eye view of the meaningful usage of data and kniiting interesting narratives from it.\n\nProfessor @ s.anand made the course all the more intersting and lively. Special thanks to him for sharing his rich corporate experience with the students.\nMy TDS experience will not be complete without  according special mention to @carlton and @Amit1 for their  commitment and handholding throughout the term.\nI feel this course should find a much higher spot than a mere 3 credit course in the whole BS degree programme.\nBest regards,\nRajesh Ramakrishnan"

    "content": "This course never fails to surprise us, whether it was the impossible ROE exam, the easiest end term exam or the sarcastic posts and responses from TA\u2019s and the professor.\nI want to take a minute to appreciate and thank the entire TDS team for this amazing course and for their efforts in teaching us in a fun and challenging way. I don\u2019t know whether i will score good or not in this course but by far this was the most enlightening course i have ever taken in this degree.\nThe course content was very well designed and it taught us the tools in data science in most practical way possible. Learning from @s.anand Sir felt like learning from some data science wizard, his ways made me think about data storytelling from a whole new perspective and also helped me in doing some data analytics projects for my resume.\nA special thanks to @carlton , for replying to each and every query/doubt on this course from the day 1, looking at someone putting in so much efforts motivates us to do better.\nGoodbye, TDS !"

Despite completing my project without much issues, a submission error (I was unaware of) occurred, and my csv file did not get submitted as I expected. And I just noticed this error (today, literally now) as I\u2019ve been busy with end term prep.\nNow that I\u2019ve explained my bit, my request is that would it be possible to go through my project to just evaluate my work and provide feedback? Since grading ended on the 25th, I know providing grading would be next to impossible. But just to understand my errors and rectify it in the future would one of the TA\u2019s or instructors be able to help me figure out errors in my project 2?\nI would really appreciate it if I was granted with such an opportunity. I just want to understand my errors before moving onto my upcoming courses. Do let me know if this would be possible. If its a positive response, I don\u2019t mind sharing my questions and answers here."

But tbh i dont really know what else they could ask in the end term for TDS since this course is more about knowing the tools than the actual syntax and stuff. Either way i just hope that the project scores are not a disappointment and that they change their minds and do relative grading for the ROE.\nThe experience in this course was great with loads of practical learning. Thanks for that to the team."

None from previous PYQs.\n\nKind regards\n  \n\n\nSince there are a lot of new elements introduced in the course this time and the exam pattern is changing (maybe similar to May 23 ET?), it would be really helpful if we could understand which apps/tools we should cover to manage our prep for the end term.\nI ask this because nearly each week lists out a number of tools and apps in the videos. Most of them are mentioned from a utility perspective and it is left up to the student to read up more on the said tools/apps. I\u2019m trying to figure out if there is a way to make the end term exam less open-ended (because it is not open-book like the ROE).\nAny advice (including a specific list of tools/apps) would be most helpful."

Just being familiar with the concepts (on a conceptual level) and familiar with what the tools are, which tool to use, for what purpose, basic functions of those tools (again not deep, just the most important/commonly used functions) will be all that is expected.\nAdditionally you will have to be familiar with the jargon of data science ( so any time some one mentions a term in the videos, like k anonymity etc) just be familiar with what those mean. Even though the questions are brand new, they will cover the same familiar areas. Data science has not changed that much, but the tools have evolved and the workflows have improved.\nHope that gives a little clarity and confidence.

I\u2019m using the word \u201cofficial\u201d because I see that the TAs have started using the same in some of their posts. I guess that is because the TAs found some of their inputs over-ridden by the instructors at a later point of time.\nIn this case, it would be really helpful if we can get specific inputs from @s.anand. Whether you talk to the Professor and then post it here or he responds directly is not really relevant, as long as the inputs are specific and are posted after a discussion with the Professor."

It was just to give a sense of the type of difficulty and the type of questions that you might see in the end term and it was not exhaustive. Your best approach will be do watch the TA revision sessions and cover everything that has been mentioned in the lectures (including basic functions of the various libraries, what tools are used for what purpose, etc)\nYou can even use the virtual TDS GPT TA to generate you a mock as it was used to assist in generating the final end term paper. It has all the source material uploaded into it including the transcripts of the lectures. Just give it an appropriate prompt and ask it to generate 40 questions for end term.\n\n\n\n\nDawn of the Virtual TA - TDS GPT TA Tools in Data Science\n\n\n    You can use this GPT for all TDS related questions as it has been uploaded with the course content. We have used it for generating Mock Question Papers and the End Term Question paper as well. Please send us feedback so we can continue to fine tune it. \nThe following was completely generated by the TDS GPT TA: \nDear Students, \nI\u2019m here to assist you as a Teaching Assistant (TA) throughout this course. My role is to help you navigate through the various concepts, assignments, and tools that you\u2026\n  \n\nRegards"

You have to count the pairs less than the parameterised distance. The GA itself has the wrong answer key, but we do have the submissions of all students. Typically the right answer was within \u00b11 of the answers shown. If thats the case you will be awarded the mark, if you selected the right answer. If the correct answer was outside the range displayed you will be awarded the mark as well.\n(see point 2)\n\nHope that gives some clarity.\nKind regards"

After downloading you can just use \"Open in notepad option\" to ensure correct formatting and submit. \nI hope this resolves the problem. In case its still unresolved please recheck your answers.\nCreated another post to share solution the previous two threads have way to many posts.\nThanks & Regards,\nSwati Jain"

Therefore the script correctly states that your submission has wrong answers. In other words it does not tell you which answers you got wrong.\nHope that gives clarity. (Unlike in the past where you could just submit one at a time until you get all the answers correct. You will not be able to do that with the current script).\nKind regards"

I luckily had the advantage of finding which answer was being flagged as wrong and eventually figured out what was wrong with it after discussing it with other students. This term however they have prevented students from using this exploit and figuring out which answer is wrong.\nMy suggestion is to collaborate with others and see where there might be a mistake. Preferably collaborate with someone who got all the answers correct. Just a friendly suggestion."

All strings must be in double quotes. \nToday I finally got an opportunity to see the validation process for the front end. We tested it and it works exactly as expected. \nGiven all correct answers in the right format as a CSV, with strings in double quotes. The front end validator (and the grader) will score you correctly. i.e No error messages will show up. If you get an error message, your answer is either wrong or not in the correct format. I once again reitera\u2026\n  \n\nPlease refer to this official post explaining clearly what you must do.\nKind regards"

Also, I still can\u2019t see the answers to GA4.\n@jkmadathil, I request the support team\u2019s help in sorting out these platform related issues well before the end term exam. I understand that a mistake in the GAs will not contribute more than a mark or two in the final score, but I\u2019ve seen situations where even that amount is enough to cost students a grade. I\u2019m just trying to avoid ending up in similar situation."

Here are some suggestions for improvements.\n\nYou should give references for where you obtained the data. This helps the reviewer to know if your sources are reliable. eg. market valued at over $145 billion (when was this and where did you get this data) What is the market value in India/Bangalore? etc.\nThe data you used for the population was 2011, is the data for the stores also from 2011? If you mix and match data from two different timescales, is the conclusion valid? Have you used projection or data from more recent sources that project reliably the population in the districts as it stands today?\nThe heat map requires a legend indicating which areas are high population vs which are low.\nShow only each vendors distribution when doing the conclusions. Otherwise its difficult to see how you reached those conclusions.\nAre you able to create an interactive deployment for the visualisation, so that users can explore your creation?\n\nIts a great display of how to use all the various data tools to create a visually compelling story.\nKind regards"

    "content": "@carlton, was looking through some previous GA,\nSuddenly found a problem that seemed a bit glaringly obvious. This was my question for Q8.\nWhich of the following word lists has the highest average cosine similarity with the word Astronomy using text-embedding-3-small?\n\nEmotional, Different, Celebrate, Authority\nEncourage, Attention, Education, Beautiful\nAstronomy, Creative, Different, Industry\nAstronomy, Creative, Knowledge, Industry\nI had checked cosine similarity and marked  option 4. Yet, the programmed answer shows that, option 1 is correct.\nActually option 1, is the least similar out of all of them. There seems to be a issue in the way the answers are programmed.\nI would be very grateful if you could check the same.\nThank you Sir.\n"

After that, I counted the number of locations within 544 and 572m of each other as asked of me by the two questions respectively.\nFor Q2 I got 205592, but the four options are 205,839 - 205,842.\nSimilarly, for Q3 I got 221478, but the four options are 220,793 - 220,796.\nPlease advise as to common mistakes that I may have made, because as you can see, my answers are fairly close, yet just slightly off. Any advice would be massively appreciated!"

So far @jkmadathil is the primary contact point with regards to these issues as he is the head of operations and the portal\u2019s chief technical architect.  I can reassure you that the problems do not affect everyone, but rather a smaller subset, because I have vetted these issues with individual students who are also taking TDS this term and have not encountered these issues. As to why, I do not know. On my end, if there are any notices on discourse, I make a note of the ids and post numbers and bring them up in our internal communications. If these are primarily disputed marks (aka its a course instructor discretion issue) then these are more appropriately dealt with by Dibu, Prasanna and S Anand.\nHope that gives some clarity. Operational issues are also best dealt with sending tickets. This gives the portal team a formal catalogue of the scale vs the hodgepodge of discourse posts (which sometimes unintentionally might be missed depending on the volume of posts)."

    "content": "TLDR, computing the distances & storing them in the dataframe is gonna take a bit under an hour. Am I doing things in the most inefficient way humanly possible, or is it just meant to take that long?\nAlso,\nIt should not take that long. My emperical testing (in terms of time taken per row) tells me it will, but estimating things in terms of no. of operations tells me max it should take a few minutes. What\u2019s up with that?\nFirst\nAm I being insane & doing things in the most basic & therefore most inefficient way possible.\nHere\u2019s my approach. I took eateries.csv, read it as pandas dataframe, got all the unique business_ids as a numpy array.\nCreated a new dist_df = pd.Dataframe(a [3623,3623] ndarray of np.inf values, index = all_biz_ids, rows = all_biz_ids)\nCreated a nested for loop (using iloc & some other schenaneigans to work \u201citeratively\u201d w/ pandas)\nfor each biz_id:\n          for each biz_id : (if they are not the exact same)\n                          look into the eateries df to get the latitudes & longitudes, compute the distance, \n                            assign it to the corresponding cell in dist_df\n\nMy code works, its just taking a bit under a second per row (I got that by temporarily adding a print row_no into my main for loop). There are 3623 rows. It is going to take an hour.\nIf that was the intent & part of the point is get that things can be time consuming, that\u2019s fine, my current plan is to run this thing while I\u2019m eating lunch. But I\u2019m 95% sure that was not the intent and I am just being an absolute mad man/simpleton.\n\nSecond\nSecond. Why is it taking this long? (my current guess is that reading from and/or writing to pandas takes WAY longer than a standard \u201coperation\u201d in python takes)\nHere\u2019s my rough estimate for how long this should take.\nThe python interpretor can handle roughly  10^7  operations per second. Alright. There\u2019s 3623 unique businesses. Squaring that, I need to compute 1,31,26,129 distances (actually I need to compute half of that many pairs cuz of how my for loop is done but let\u2019s just ignore that).\nLet\u2019s be really generous & say computing the distances for a pair of points requires 50 operations (I\u2019m really trying to invent a worst possible case scenario here).\nThat\u2019s still 50 \\times 1,31,26,129 = 65,63,06,450  operations which divided by 10^7 \\times 60 tells me this should take on the order or magnitude of a couple of minutes.\nThat\u2019s still a while in absolute terms, but its a lot less than an hour.\nMy laptop\u2019s specs aren\u2019t the limitting factor either, I run adope after effects (possibly the worlds least optimized, most needlessly hungry application outside of a never ending while loop) on this thing & it handles it well; outside of the GPU (which is just integrated graphics) its a very well speced & fairly new chap."

    "content": "The first big optimization you would do is cut the duplicate calculations that your logic would have. You only need to compute the top half of the triangular matrix, the rest would be just duplicate calculations if you visualise the relationships between the sets of businesses as a matrix.\nFor loops with pandas is one the most inefficient way to deal with pandas dataframes.\nFor all you aspiring data scientists, if you want to level up from pottering panda to Kung fu panda, Please read on\u2026\nEfficiently iterating over rows in a Pandas DataFrame\nby\nMaxime Labonne\nPh.D., Staff ML Scientist @ Liquid AI \u2022 Author of \u201cHands-On Graph Neural Networks\u201d\nPublished in\nTowards Data Science\nMar 21, 2022\n6 min read\n1280\u00d7720 200 KB\nImage by author, emojis by OpenMoji (CC BY-SA 4.0).\nWhen I started machine learning, I followed the guidelines and created my own features by combining multiple columns in my dataset. It\u2019s all well and good, but the way I did it was horribly inefficient. I had to wait several minutes to do the most basic operations.\nMy problem was simple: I didn\u2019t know the fastest way to iterate over rows in Pandas.\nI often see people online using the same techniques I used to apply. It\u2019s not elegant but it\u2019s ok if you don\u2019t have much data. However, if you process more than 10k rows, it quickly becomes an obvious performance issue.\nIn this article, I\u2019m gonna give you the best way to iterate over rows in a Pandas DataFrame, with no extra code required. It\u2019s not just about performance: it\u2019s also about understanding what\u2019s going on under the hood to become a better data scientist.\nLet\u2019s import a dataset in Pandas. In this case, I chose the one I worked on when I started: it\u2019s time to fix my past mistakes! \nYou can run the code with the following Google Colab notebook.\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\ndf = pd.read_csv(\u2018https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mlabonne/how-to-data-science/main/data/nslkdd_test.txt\u2019)\nThis dataset has 22k rows and 43 columns with a combination of categorical and numerical values. Each row describes a connection between two computers.\nLet\u2019s say we want to create a new feature: the total number of bytes in the connection. We just have to sum up two existing features: src_bytes and dst_bytes. Let\u2019s see different methods to calculate this new feature.\n 1. Iterrows\nAccording to the official documentation, iterrows() iterates \u201cover the rows of a Pandas DataFrame as (index, Series) pairs\u201d. It converts each row into a Series object, which causes two problems:\n\nIt can change the type of your data (dtypes);\nThe conversion greatly degrades performance.\n\nFor these reasons, the ill-named iterrows() is the WORST possible method to actually iterate over rows.\n%%timeit -n 10\n# Iterrows\ntotal = []\nfor index, row in df.iterrows():\ntotal.append(row['src_bytes'] + row['dst_bytes'])\n\n\n10 loops, best of 5: 1.07 s per loop\n\nNow let\u2019s see slightly better techniques\u2026\n 2. For loop with .loc or .iloc (3\u00d7 faster)\nThis is what I used to do when I started: a basic for loop to select rows by index (with .loc or .iloc).\nWhy is it bad? Because DataFrames are not designed for this purpose. As with the previous method, rows are converted into Pandas Series objects, which degrades performance.\nInterestingly enough,.iloc is faster than .loc. It makes sense since Python doesn\u2019t have to check user-defined labels and directly look at where the row is stored in memory.\n%%timeit -n 10\n# For loop with .loc\ntotal = []\nfor index in range(len(df)):\ntotal.append(df['src_bytes'].loc[index] + df['dst_bytes'].loc[index])\n\n\n10 loops, best of 5: 600 ms per loop\n\n%%timeit -n 10\n# For loop with .iloc\ntotal = []\nfor index in range(len(df)):\ntotal.append(df['src_bytes'].iloc[index] + df['dst_bytes'].iloc[index])\n\n\n10 loops, best of 5: 377 ms per loop\n\nEven this basic for loop with .iloc is 3 times faster than the first method!\n 3. Apply (4\u00d7 faster)\nThe apply() method is another popular choice to iterate over rows. It creates code that is easy to understand but at a cost: performance is nearly as bad as the previous for loop.\nThis is why I would strongly advise you to avoid this function for this specific purpose (it\u2019s fine for other applications).\nNote that I convert the DataFrame into a list using the to_list() method to obtain identical results.\n%%timeit -n 10\n# Apply\ndf.apply(lambda row: row['src_bytes'] + row['dst_bytes'], axis=1).to_list()\n\n\n10 loops, best of 5: 282 ms per loop\n\nThe apply() method is a for loop in disguise, which is why the performance doesn\u2019t improve that much: it\u2019s only 4 times faster than the first technique.\n 4. Itertuples (10\u00d7 faster)\nIf you know about iterrows(), you probably know about itertuples(). According to the official documentation, it iterates \u201cover the rows of a DataFrame as namedtuples of the values\u201d. In practice, it means that rows are converted into tuples, which are much lighter objects than Pandas Series.\nThis is why itertuples() is a better version of iterrows(). This time, we need to access the values with an attribute (or an index). If you want to access them with a string (e.g., if there\u2019s a space in the string), you can use the getattr() function instead.\n%%timeit -n 10\n# Itertuples\ntotal = []\nfor row in df.itertuples():\ntotal.append(row.src_bytes + row.dst_bytes)\n\n\n10 loops, best of 5: 99.3 ms per loop\n\nThis is starting to look better: it is now 10 times faster than iterrows() .\n 5. List comprehensions (200\u00d7 faster)\nList comprehensions are a fancy way to iterate over a list as a one-liner.\nFor instance, [print(i) for i in range(10)] prints numbers from 0 to 9 without any explicit for loop. I say \u201cexplicit\u201d because Python actually processes it as a for loop if we look at the bytecode.\nSo why is it faster? Quite simply because we don\u2019t call the .append() method in this version.\n%%timeit -n 100\n# List comprehension\n[src + dst for src, dst in zip(df['src_bytes'], df['dst_bytes'])]\n\n\n100 loops, best of 5: 5.54 ms per loop\n\nIndeed, this technique is 200 times faster than the first one! But we can still do better.\n 6. Pandas vectorization (1500\u00d7 faster)\nUntil now, all the techniques used simply add up single values. Instead of adding single values, why not group them into vectors to sum them up? The difference between adding two numbers or two vectors is not significant for a CPU, which should speed things up.\nOn top of that, Pandas can process Series objects in parallel, using every CPU core available!\nThe syntax is also the simplest imaginable: this solution is extremely intuitive. Under the hood, Pandas takes care of vectorizing our data with an optimized C code using contiguous memory blocks.\n%%timeit -n 1000\n# Vectorization\n(df['src_bytes'] + df['dst_bytes']).to_list()\n\n\n1000 loops, best of 5: 734 \u00b5s per loop\n\nThis code is 1500 times faster than iterrows() and it is even simpler to write.\n 7. NumPy vectorization (1900\u00d7 faster)\nNumPy is designed to handle scientific computing. It has less overhead than Pandas methods since rows and dataframes all become np.array. It relies on the same optimizations as Pandas vectorization.\nThere are two ways of converting a Series into a np.array: using .values or .to_numpy(). The former has been deprecated for years, which is why we\u2019re gonna use .to_numpy() in this example.\n%%timeit -n 1000\n# Numpy vectorization\n(df['src_bytes'].to_numpy() + df['dst_bytes'].to_numpy()).tolist()\n\n\n1000 loops, best of 5: 575 \u00b5s per loop\n\nWe found our winner with a technique that is 1900 times faster than our first competitor! Let\u2019s wrap things up.\n Conclusion\n1400\u00d7720 136 KB\nThe number of rows in the dataset can greatly impact the performance of certain techniques (image by author).\nDon\u2019t be like me: if you need to iterate over rows in a DataFrame, vectorization is the way to go! You can find the code to reproduce the experiments at this address. Vectorization is not harder to read, it doesn\u2019t take longer to write, and the performance gain is incredible.\nIt\u2019s not just about performance: understanding how each method works under the hood helped me to write better code. Performance gains are always based on the same techniques: transforming data into vectors and matrices to take advantage of parallel processing. Alas, this is often at the expense of readability. But it doesn\u2019t have to be.\nIterating over rows is just an example but it shows that, sometimes, you can have the cake and eat it. \n\nKind regards,\nFrom your friendly TDS TA\nPS.\n\n\u201cThere is no cake\u201d\nby the test subject Doug Rattman in the Aperture Science Computer-Aided Enrichment Center  before his untimely demise caused by the artificially superintelligent computer GlaDOS.\n"
