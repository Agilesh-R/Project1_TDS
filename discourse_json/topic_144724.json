Whether it was the ROE (which makes me wish for it in place of oppe exams) or the Mission Mars 1-mark optional projects, it was more than I could have asked for when registering for the TDS course.</li>\n<li>One thing I feel I missed to fully experience the essence of TDS was the weekly Wednesday sessions by Dibu John Sir, as I only watched the recorded sessions on YouTube. When certain modules towards the end of the course had previous term recordings where Dibu Sir interacted with students, I felt I missed something valuable.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All the course content provided significant value, thanks to the TDS team <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/raised_hands.png?v=12\" title=\":raised_hands:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":raised_hands:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\">.</p>\n<p>Not just the official team, but the student community in TDS this term was also a delight, especially the efforts of <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/arif\">@Arif</a> in supporting us through the difficulties we faced.</p>",

Initially, Week 1 felt very easy but as the weeks progressed, I felt there were so many tools to learn and handle data differently. This is one of the courses where I didn’t make any handwritten notes which I usually have done for all the courses expect English (mostly done with both diplomas).</p>\n<p>The bonus assignments quite interesting &amp; good for practicing practical skills although I couldn’t do all due to busy schedule and health issues. I did visit discourse from time to time hoping to find more extra activity but later started helping peers &amp; posting my doubts here.</p>\n<p>As for ROE 1 didn’t feel it that was difficult but had I not have gotten confused with that timing issue (slowed my paced a little thinking it was an hour) I would have done 2 more questions right. It was good though.</p>\n<p>The projects helped me put my skills to test which ROE didn’t. I used ChatGPT and it worked out so I gave that ROE marks credit to that GPT LLM.</p>\n<p>At the very last, I was unsure how to prepare for End term but my peers helped me and will post my digital notes (that’s what I prepared a week ago) after  polishing a bit for next term students.</p>\n<p><a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/s.anand\">@s.anand</a> sir’s guidance &amp; teachings helped a lot in building these skills and both the TAs were there to help us <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/amit1\">@Amit1</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/carlton\">@carlton</a> (can’t thank enough).</p>\n<p><a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/debasmit\">@Debasmit</a> used ChatGPT fine-tuned for TDS to generate 300+ questions which were really helpful for end term a big thanks to him.</p>\n<p>End term was a breeze completed within 10-15 minutes with hardly 1-2 questions wrong (mistakes checked with answer key - some courses have released that)</p>\n<p>Overall, it was a nice experience with some hiccups like issues in GAs &amp; projects but that’s part &amp; parcel of life (nothing is perfect). I hope I will be able to put these skills to good use in real life.</p>\n<p>Wishing the best for everyone here…</p>\n<p>Thanks &amp; Regards,<br>\nSwati Jain</p>",

I slowly started gaining confidence after watching the videos and TA session recordings multiple times.</p>\n<p>But that confidence was only short lived as I  was completely  overrun by the ROE juggernaut. I thought ROE is a real out of the box masterclass . It prepares one to handle real world decision making situations in a better way (utilizing limited resources in a optimal manner).</p>\n<p>I would say the course was very well designed and structured capturing all the widely used DS tools. It is also heartening to see the course contents being regularly updated to remain in sync with the rapidly changing  tools and technologies used in data science.</p>\n<p>At the end of it, it is only postive takeaways for me from this course.  Specifically:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Exposure to various tools used in present day DS industry.</li>\n<li>Kindling interest to delve deeper in to these tools.</li>\n<li>Giving a birds eye view of the meaningful usage of data and kniiting interesting narratives from it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Professor @ s.anand made the course all the more intersting and lively.
